Levitating,Dua Lipa,"TranslationsTürkçeEspañolEnglishDeutschFrançaisNederlandsLevitating Lyrics[Verse 1]
If you wanna run away with me, I know a galaxy
And I can take you for a ride
I had a premonition that we fell into a rhythm
Where the music don't stop for life
Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes
Shining just the way I like
If you're feeling like you need a little bit of company
You met me at the perfect time

[Pre-Chorus]
You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way, we're renegading
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating
You, moonlight, you're my starlight (You're the moonlight)
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating

[Verse 2]
I believe that you're for me, I feel it in our energy
I see us written in the stars
We can go wherever, so let's do it now or never
Baby, nothing's ever, ever too far
Glitter in the sky, glitter in our eyes
Shining just the way we are
I feel like we're forever every time we get together
But whatever, let's get lost on Mars

Walking round, acting brand new
I don't wanna see you yelling oof
But you ain't got a clue
Afk and lagging out too
Running 'round in yellow green and blue
Why you always such a noob
Walking round, acting brand new
I don't wanna see you yelling oof
But you ain't got a clue
Afk and lagging out too
Running 'round in yellow green and blue
Now i'm on the golden gun
Going for that arsenal dub
Somehow never got my builder's club
Newbie, i'm not an oder
Won't you ever understand
I only simp for builderman
Boy it's obvious that you're such a noob
Laggy internet that you barely move
And you love dying in murder mystery 2
Now i'm tired of you acting so confused
We play games we love and have fun with our free time
We've fallen before but we laugh in the meantime
Why you always such a noob
Walking round, acting brand new
I don't wanna see you yelling oof
But you ain't got a clue

Running 'round in yellow green and blue
Why you always such a noob
Walking round, acting brand new
I don't wanna see you yelling oof
But you ain't got a clue
Afk and lagging out too
Running 'round in yellow green and blue
So why's it saying you're online but you don't show up
We could stick to playing the blox as we grow up
If i could then i would give you all my robux
But i'm sorry i can only give you bobux
I'm talking anthro
Arsenal, winning every bloxy
Finding every key to escape from the piggy
Got a tycoon, now i'm spitting out money
Got a simulator full of bees making honey
We play games we love and have fun with our free time
We've fallen before but we laugh in the meantime
Why you always such a noob
Walking round, acting brand new
I don't wanna see you yelling oof
But you ain't got a clue
Afk and lagging out too
Running 'round in yellow green and blue
Why you always such a noob
Walking round, acting brand new
I don't wanna see you yelling oof

Well, good for you, I guess you moved on really easily
You found a new girl and it only took a couple weeks
Remember when you said that you wanted to give me the world?

And good for you, I guess that you've been workin' on yourself
I guess that therapist I found for you, she really helped
Now you can be a better man for your brand new girl (Girl)

Well, good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doin' great out there without me, baby
God, I wish that I could do that
I've lost my mind, I've spent the night
Cryin' on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you

[Verse 2]
Well, good for you, I guess you're gettin' everything you want (Ah)
You bought a new car and your career's really takin' off (Ah)
It's like we never even happened
Baby, what the fuck is up with that? (Ah)
And good for you, it's like you never even met me
Remember when you swore to God I was the only
Person who ever got you? Well, screw that, and screw you

Strawberry ice cream, one spoon for two
And tradin' jackets
Laughin’ 'bout how small it looks on you

Watching reruns of Glee
Bein' annoying, singin’ in harmony
I bet she's braggin' to all her friends, sayin' you're so unique, hmm

So when you gonna tell her that we did that, too?
She thinks it's special, but it's all reused
That was our place, I found it first
I made the jokes you tell to her when she's with you
Do you get déjà vu when she’s with you?
Do you get déjà vu? (Ah) Hmm
Do you get déjà vu, huh?

[Verse 2]
Do you call her, almost say my name?
’Cause let's be honest, we kinda do sound the same
Another actress
I hate to think that I was just your type
And I bet that she knows Billy Joel
’Cause you played her ""Uptown Girl""
You're singin' it together
Now I bet you even tell her how you love her
In between the chorus and the verse (Ooh; I love you)

A good truck's got maybe three hundred thousand

A needle drop on a forty-five

Sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll

But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
Just a T-shirt in the kitchen
With no make-up and a million
Other things that I could look at my whole life
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts
Maybe some things last forever after all

When your brain goes numb, you can call that mental freeze
When these people talk too much, put that shit in slow motion, yeah
I feel like an astronaut in the ocean, ayy
What you know about rollin' down in the deep?
When your brain goes numb, you can call that mental freeze
When these people talk too much, put that shit in slow motion, yeah
I feel like an astronaut in the ocean

[Verse 1]
She say that I'm cool (Damn straight)
I'm like, ""Yeah, that's true"" (That's true)
I believe in G-O-D (Ayy)
Don't believe in T-H-O-T
She keep playing me dumb (Play me)
I'ma play her for fun (Uh-huh)
Y'all don't really know my mental
Let me give you the picture like stencil
Fallin' out in a drought
No flow, rain wasn't pourin' down (Pourin' down)
See, that pain was all around
See, my mode was kinda lounged
Didn't know which, which way to turn
Flow was cool but I still felt burnt
Energy up, you can feel my surge
I'ma kill everything like this purge (Ayy)
You might also like[Bridge]
Let's just get this straight for a second, I'ma work (Yuh)
Even if I don't get paid for progression, I'ma get it (Uh, get it)
Everything that I do is electric (Ayy)
I'ma keep it in a motion, keep it movin' like kinetic, ayy (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
Put this shit in a frame, better know I don't blame
Everything that I say, man, I seen you deflate
Let me elevate, this ain't a prank
Have you walkin' on a plank, li-li-li-li-like
Both hands together, God, let me pray (Now let me pray), uh
I've been goin' right, right around, call that relay (Masked Wolf)
Pass the baton, back and I'm on
Swimmin' in the pool, Kendrick Lamar, uh (Ayy)
Want a piece of this, a piece of mine, my peace a sign
Can you please read between the lines?
My rhyme's inclined to break your spine (Spine)
They say that I'm so fine (Fine)
You could never match my grind (True)
Please do not, not waste my time (Wolf)

[Chorus]
What you know about rollin' down in the deep?
When your brain goes numb, you can call that mental freeze
When these people talk too much, put that shit in slow motion, yeah
I feel like an astronaut in the ocean, ayy
What you know about rollin' down in the deep?
When your brain goes numb, you can call that mental freeze
When these people talk too much, put that shit in slow motion, yeah
I feel like an astronaut in the ocean67Embed"

Lately I've been prayin', God, I wonder, can You hear me?
Thinkin' 'bout the old me, I swear I miss you dearly
Stay down 'til you come up, I've been stickin' to that theory
Every day a battle, I'm exhausted and I'm weary
Make sure I smile in public, when alone, my eyes teary
I fought through it all, but that shit hurt me severely

When they ask if I'm okay, it just make everything seem worse
Try and explain your feelings, sound like something you rehearsed
Stabbed me in my back with a clean smirk
Lookin' so deep into your eyes, I can read your thoughts, so
Shut the fuck—, I mean, please don't talk
I done been through too much and I don't need another loss
Put that on every war scar for every battle I fought
[Chorus]
Uh, copped a BMW, new deposit, I picked up another bag
Like fuck it, I'ma count while I'm in it
I hear planes flyin', crowds screamin', money counters, chains clangin'
Shit, I guess that's how it sound when you winnin'
I ain't jokin', do it sound like I'm kiddin'?
I been makin' like two thousand a minute
So high up through the clouds, I was swimmin'
I'm probably gon' drown when I'm in it
I bet she gon' get loud when I'm in it
And we might have a child when I'm finished

Выучил о тройном кресте, когда был молодым и я знаю, что не пойду, так что я держу пушку
Я полетел в Париж просто, чтобы купить Dior
Она просит внимания, я не вижу её
C.I.P Pop, я хочу, чтобы ты мог увидеть нас

Мы не можем испачкать мои сиденья, потому что они белые (Это мои сиденья, смотри на мои сиденья)
Я живу, как в ""Thriller"", я выхожу только ночью
Она не трахается с ликёром, не любит быть выпившей
Она не пьёт Henny, только белое вино (Что она делает?)
Открыл пробку в новом Pinot Grigio (Да)
Подъехал на Porsche с причудливой шлюхой (Зум)
Паркую Porsche и подъезжаю на Lambo (Хмф)
Я выпрыгиваю, Майор Пейн, раскачиваю камуфляж (Да сэр)
Думаю она милая, заставляю её трахаться, дай её мужчине идти (Она милая)
Люблю стрелять, зажигать тебя, сука, я Рембо

Покойся с миром Pop, заставь меня скурить тебя

I Hope,Gabby Barrett Featuring Charlie Puth,"I Hope (Remix) Lyrics[Intro: Charlie Puth]
Yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, yeah

[Verse 1: Gabby Barrett]
I, I hope she makes you smile
The way you made me smile on the other end of a phone
In the middle of a highway driving alone
Oh, baby, I, I hope you hear a song
That makes you sing along and gets you thinkin' 'bout her
Then the last several miles turn into a blur, yeah

[Chorus: Gabby Barrett]
I hope you're both feelin' sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night
I hope you never ever felt more free
Tell your friends that you're so happy
I hope she comes along and wrecks every one of your plans
I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand
I hope she's wilder than your wildest dreams
She's everything you're ever gonna need
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me

Yeah, babe, I hope he shows up in a 2 AM pic from a friend
Hanging on to a girl to just rub it in
I hope you stay up all night all alone, waitin' by the phone
And then he calls
And baby, I, I hope you work it out
Forgive and just about forget
Let him take you on a first date again
And when you lean in for a kiss

[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
I hope you're both feelin' sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know he's the one by the end of the night
I hope you never ever felt more free
Tell your friends that you're so happy
I hope he comes along and wrecks every one of your plans
I hope he spends his last dime to put a rock on your hand
I hope he's wilder than your wildest dreams
He's everything you're ever gonna need
And then I hope he cheats
Like you did on me
And then I hope he cheats
Like you did on me

[Bridge: Gabby Barrett]
I hope what goes comes all the way around
I hope she makes you feel the same way about her
That I feel about you right now
[Chorus: Gabby Barrett & Charlie Puth]
I hope you're both feelin' sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night
I hope you never ever felt more free
Tell your friends that you're so happy (Oh woah, oh)
I hope she comes along and wrecks every one of your plans (Oh)
I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand
I hope she's wilder than your wildest dreams
She's everything you're ever gonna need
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me

Wockesha,Moneybagg Yo,"TranslationsPortuguêsWockesha Lyrics[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, I kinda put the cup down for a minute but umm
But honestly, it ain't nobody's business what's in my cup, what's in your cup, what's in they cup
It's your cup, drink it
So whatever the hell was in my cup, the only reaction I did was got more popular, more successful
Than a lot more things that I've ever done, I probably should pick that cup back up (Haha)

[Verse 1]
I'm sittin' here lookin' at Keisha, like, ""Do you love me, do you love me not?""
Damn, you hit the spot
Taste like candy (Candy), sweet like fruit (Ooh)
Wet like water, can I love on you?
Withdrawals, I'm feelin' different, every day I need a dose
Every now and thеn I'm missin', I got my times when I go ghost
But she minе (Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm), I'm stampin' her
Priority status, so them other bitches mad at her (Too mad, ha)
Thumbin' through a hunnid thou', I spent that times two on you
Caught myself cuttin' you loose, then I pop back up like peekaboo
Here I go, flyer than most, Louis V coat
Gas station, coffee cup full, I don't drive boats, no
Money can't buy happiness but she found love inside a G
Head and somethin' to eat, that's all a thug nigga need
No lie you get me higher than the prices on my weed
I'm displayin' my feelings like I'm wearing 'em on my sleeve (See)

[Pre-Chorus]
One minute I'm done with you, the next one I be runnin' back
Go your way, I go my way but somehow we be still attached
Tryna find my answers with this cup, but ain't no truth in that
They be like, I'm dumb for fuckin' with you, I spend stupid racks
You might also like[Chorus]
I'm sittin' here knowing I don't need ya pouring O's in the lid
Sippin' chaser with my reefer, can't get my mind off Wockesha
Watch me put my heart in this cup
In my feelings, she my therapist, I'ma talk to this cup (I swear)

[Verse 2]
Ring around the rose-z, cup full of OZ's
I hope I don't OD, she keep sayin', ""Pour me""
Turn me to that purple demon emoji (Devil)
Fuck me like you miss me, it's been a whole week
This ain't no playground love, we grown (Too grown)
I'm too fucked up, I paid four hunnid for a zone (That strong)
My bitch don't like you, you've been fuckin' up my home (In my house)
Relapsin' every time I try to leave you 'lone (I relapse, girl)
Every nigga in the street lookin' for her but she rare
Dark skin, purple hair, stingy, with her hard to share (I can't)
Never needed nobody but it feel good to have somebody (That somebody)
Drop you and pick you up whenever I feel like it
This shit toxic
Let me know if you feel me, hmm-hmm (Hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm, hmm)
I gotta stop it, I must stop it

[Pre-Chorus]
One minute I'm done with you, the next one I be runnin' back
Go your way, I go my way but somehow we be still attached
Tryna find my answers with this cup, but ain't no truth in that
They be like, I'm dumb for fuckin' with you, I spend stupid racks
[Chorus]
I'm sittin' here knowing I don't need ya pouring O's in the lid
Sippin' chaser with my reefer, can't get my mind off Wockesha
Watch me put my heart in this cup
In my feelings, she my therapist, I'ma talk to this cup (I swear)

Beat Box,SpotemGottem Featuring Pooh Shiesty Or DaBaby,"Beatbox (ft. XXXTENTACION, Juice WRLD, DaBaby, Polo G, NLE Choppa, Pooh Shiesty, DDG, Young M.A., Lil Yachty & SpottemGottem) Lyrics[Intro: XXXTENTACION]
Turn the beat up a little bit
Ayy, huh, yuh, ayy, yuh

[Verse 1: XXXTENTACION]
Yah, murder gang, uh
Run and make a nigga lose his vertebrae, uh
Southside nigga, murder everything, uh
Shots fire, make a nigga run, man (Fire, fire)
I sent your grandma a dick pic, uh
Got that bitch all on my dick tip, uh
I am so strange like a misfit, uh
Kick that bitch out, she indifferent, uh
Feel a nigga mind, see a nigga grind
Fuckin' gold mine of a mind
Full kai, Super Saiyan on these niggas
Fightin' birds in the damn sky 'cause I'm damn fly
Gold mine of a mind
Full kai, Super Saiyan on these niggas
Ayy, grind on my dick like a Ripstik, uh
My body count is like 60, uh
Your bitch on me, she need CPR
I fucked that bitch right on DVR
I slapped that meat on her cheeky, yes
I sucked her toes, yes I'm freaky, yes
Caught a grand theft just like GTA
If he talk shit, watch me beat him, ayy
Hop on that beat and I beat the A
Work-work-work, shout out to RiRi, ayy
Keep a blade on me like Sasuke, uh
Shout out my nigga ImDontai, uh
Build to the pussy like Fortnite, uh
My dick is stuck in your whore like oww!
Patty cake, patty cake
Work my wrist like patty cake
Two white bitches like Mary-Kate
Nigga want beef like patty cake, ayy
Eat my dick like sirloin steak
Rape, bitch, that's my fetish, ayy
I don't speak your language, Rosetta, hmm
Only speak the language of a lettuce, hey
Patty cake, patty cake
You finna get some dick today
Drop neck on me like a lynch, bitch, limp dick
Put it on your daughter and she still caught a nut
Patty cake, patty cake
Nutted on your bitch like Jon and Kate
ATL pull up in roller-skates
Work my tongue like a vibrator, ayy
Post up, ayy, fucked up, nigga, fuck's up?
Bitch-made, wrist like slay, ayy
Where that bitch? Dirty Dan, ayy, fifty grand, ayy
I need that in rubber bands, ayy
That's a lot, ayy, break the pot, beat the pot, ayy
Like abuse, ayy, chain tight like a noose, ayy
My nose runny like a marathon, marathon
I get head for free I got coupons, coupons
Stuck my dick inside your bitch like a... tampon
You might also like[Interlude 1: XXXTENTACION]
Haha! I'm just... I'm just gon' stop rapping
I'm just gon' stop rapping right now, on this song
Not... I mean, not in... not in, in general, but just on this song 'cause
You slumped out?
I ain't... yeah, I ain't tryna... I ain't tryna destroy these niggas

[Chorus: SpotEmGottem]
Bur— Bur— Burn away a carbon beam, knock your legs off
Tried to get away from me, had a standoff
Hit him in the spine, knock his dreads off
My woadie just caught a body, I nicknamed him Randy Moss
Thuggin' in my Reeboks, riding with a G-SHOCK
Shh, I heard he shot, Draco make 'em beat box
He made that sharp turn, woadie spot 'em, peeled the car
Had a mask on, Draco make 'em beat box

[Verse 2: Juice WRLD]
I've been daydreaming when I'm on the percs
Niggas broke as a joke, they ain't puttin' in work
We all toting them poles, we'll take a few souls
Even my lil' bitch got a gun in her purse
It's been about three months, I was sippin' that syrup
Had me sleepwalkin', talking with a slur
If I catch him walking, leave him on the curb
Desert Eagle will shoot him, call it Larry Bird
Play with your bitch, yeah she insecure
She know that I'm Juice Man, 2Pac Shakur
She know that I know how to make pussy purr
Your nigga he ugly, he creepin', a nerd, ayy
Huh, I'm sure he probably be slippin' hoes roofies for sure
I don't need no molly for me to be savage
I don't need no molly to give you the world
Got a couple AP's, I don't fuck with no Pateks
But guess it's the best, so I got 'em, they dance
And I'm rich as a bitch, I don't know how to manage
Bank account like the zoo, goin' apes and bananas
Smokin' dope 'till I choke up and rollin' up Runtz
You want smoke then my niggas'll give you the cancer
Like a bad TV show in this ho, you'll get cancelled
I'm Michael Jackson, nigga, you Randy, uh
Do it so effortless, make it look easy
I gave my girl dick when she screamin' out, ""Feed me""
One in the head, F.N on preheat
Hit a bitch nigga face, ain't CB, RiRi
Diamonds on water, my VVS on Fiji
I'm magic even when I'm bored, Ouija
Niggas need me to make an all-star team
Take the score motherfucker, I know you need me
No limit nigga, on limitless pills
I been high for a minute, this shit gettin' critical
My baby told me that she'll kill for me
That turn me on, so I eat the pussy like cereal
I'm doin' shit that I wasn't a year ago
I go to London, come back, I'm like, ""Cheerio""
Hang with the criminals, you get to trippin'
They blickin', break your ass down, mineral (Mineral)
[Interlude 2: Juice WRLD]
Mhm, niggas gettin' mad at me I got idol money, like
They keep that shit, it's gon' be a no from me, dawg, haha
On bro, I be talkin' my shit, rich nigga shit
I could back it up though, no cap
Let's go

[Chorus: SpotEmGottem]
Bur— Bur— Burn away a carbon beam, knock your legs off
Tried to get away from me, had a standoff
Hit him in the spine, knock his dreads off
My woadie just caught a body, I nicknamed him Randy Moss
Thuggin' in my Reeboks, riding with a G-SHOCK
Shh, I heard he shot, Draco make 'em beat box
He made that sharp turn, woadie spot 'em, peeled the car
Had a mask on, Draco make 'em beat box

[Verse 3: SpotEmGottem]
In Miami with my motherfuckin' heat out
With another nigga bitch, said she got her feet out
I walked in the party, I'm on my big four shit
Ready to get it started, bitch, I got no sense
Oh, he the plug, ridin' 'round with four bricks
Call me Kobe, twenty-four on me
Can't fuck wit' her no more, bad lil' bitch, she do the most
I get my groove on every time I see them folks
I got the antidote, I'm thinking that's something you need to know
I'm smooth and I'm cold, she know my wrist on froze
Skinny jeans on with a big bankroll
She playin' my song, I got her takin' off her thong
I'm tryna get it on, she feeling all over my Peter bone
Two rights don't make a wrong, it just go on and on
I'm kickin' shit like Jackie Chan today, got my kicks on
I aim, I hit my target, I'ma up this bitch regardless
[Chorus: SpotEmGottem]
Bur— Bur— Burn away a carbon beam, knock your legs off
Tried to get away from me, had a standoff
Hit him in the spine, knock his dreads off
My woadie just caught a body, I nicknamed him Randy Moss
Thuggin' in my Reeboks, riding with a G-SHOCK
Shh, I heard he shot, Draco make 'em beat box
He made that sharp turn, woadie spot 'em, peeled the car
Had a mask on, Draco make 'em beat box
Bur— Bur— Burn away a carbon beam, knock your legs off
Tried to get away from me, had a standoff
Hit him in the spine, knock his dreads off
My woadie just caught a body, I nicknamed him Randy Moss
Thu— thu— thuggin' in my Reeboks, riding with a G-SHOCK
Shh, I heard he shot, Draco make 'em beat box
He made that sharp turn, woadie spot 'em, peeled the car
Had a mask on, Draco make 'em beat box

[Verse 4: DaBaby]
Ready to get it started, nigga (Go)
Whenever you want it
I was the man with the plan since a shawty
Pull up to the Grammy Awards with my .40 (Damn E, this shit exclusive)
She told me she like how I'm dressin' and I ain't eatin' no salad (Uh-huh)
Stevie Wonder can see that I'm havin'
I told her, ""Be patient,"" she waited
I gave her the dick, she walked out doin' the ""Beat Box Challenge""
Like yeah, get in there, baby (Get in there)
You know me, hit you anywhere, baby (Let's go)
Know she gon' do whatever I say
I could piss in a cup, call it lemonade, baby
Let that bitch off, I'm a renegade, baby
I'ma get outta there, I ain't feelin' that (Huh?)
Nigga run up on me with a cellphone out
He gon' fuck around, die on the internet (Doo-doo-doo-doo)
Fuck it, kill him on IG Live
Let the whole world see the nigga die (Die)
Yeah, shout-out to SpotEm', we got 'em (Get down)
Even though he a rapper, he shot him
I get this big pretty-ass smile from my mama (Cheese)
Get this motherfuckin' voice from my daddy
I learned how to pimp on them hoes from my uncle (Pimp, pimp)
Let her suck on my toes 'cause I'm nasty (Okay)
Like fuck it, she asked me to do it
Play with me, I'ma actually shoot you
Most of these niggas be cap and we knew it
These niggas drop shit and we laugh at they music
I know how to murder these niggas with kindness
Fuckin' they bitch from the back, how I do it
I buy a Cuban and fill it with diamonds
Send my assistant to pick up some condoms
Instagram model at the hotel textin' me now
Want me to give her the Johnson
Damn, that nigga Baby on fire and it won't go out
They know that lil' nigga's a problem
Got a big .45 on decock (Go)
Usin' big words like I'm T.I. (Turn up)
Don't wanna get me started, nigga
Turn me up, niggas gon' see why
Nigga, you a bitch, JoJo Siwa (Bitch)
You let the wrong nigga get rich
Both of these chains on my neck, they compete with each other
They fightin' and throwin' a fit
Know how these hoes like to argue and beef with each other
She fightin' now, over the dick
You should already know you ain't searchin' DaBaby
'Cause that nigga like to come in with the stick
I don't like to get into the mix (No)
I done got paid in full, my nigga
I get them hoes like I'm Mitch
Even got white people all on my dick (Go)
Yeah, second year, six-time Grammy-nominated
Came through turnt up, everybody hated
Before I had my first M, it was Billion Dollar Baby
He bet the house and his self like Las Vegas (Go)
You want the shit? Gotta earn it
He off the leash, he don't think he can get murdered
Know how to swim, so I fuck with who fuckin' with me
I take a bridge and I burn it
Let me see if you can swim, lil' nigga
Shit gettin' out of hand, I just parked a new Benz
Hopped in a new Benz, lil' nigga (Let's go)
And Ion't want new friends

[Chorus: SpotEmGottem]
Bur— Bur— Burn away a carbon beam, knock your legs off
Tried to get away from me, had a standoff
Hit him in the spine, knock his dreads off
My woadie just caught a body, I nicknamed him Randy Moss
Thuggin' in my Reeboks, riding with a G-SHOCK
Shh, I heard he shot, Draco make 'em beat box
He made that sharp turn, woadie spot 'em, peeled the car
Had a mask on, Draco make 'em beat box

[Verse 5: Polo G]
FN knock his head off (Knock his head off)
Fuck the jakes, we sped off (Fuck the jakes, we sped off)
Dissin' on the 'net 'bout Ed and Lil Bid got his mans chalked
We gon' take his life, bitch, that's how much dissin' the dead cost
I put that lil' bag up on his wig, he got his dreads bought
Tried to run, them bullets hawked him down, we left his legs crossed
We can speak 'bout bitches or this money, don't do fed talk
Hundred on my wrist watch
AP make her lick cock
In a mansion I bought mama, with my lil' sis' making TikToks
Lil Jo let that stick pop
Smoke opps out the ziplock
We gon' leave a brick shot
Chase him out his flip-flops
Catch him on the day you play with us and get your bitch shot
See them lights and take 'em on the chase, don't do no pitstops
Too Turnt Gang, we drop the rakes
Kill 'em, what my chopper say
Fuck it, let that chopper spray
Caught him snoozin', shot his face
I was taught to get close on your man, don't shoot from blocks away
I call my lil' killer, ""What's the plan? Let's whack an opp today""
Gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, bitch (Bitch)

[Chorus: SpotEmGottem]
Bur— Bur— Burn away a carbon beam, knock your legs off
Tried to get away from me, had a standoff
Hit him in the spine, knock his dreads off
My woadie just caught a body, I nicknamed him Randy Moss
Thuggin' in my Reeboks, riding with a G-SHOCK
Shh, I heard he shot, Draco make 'em beat box
He made that sharp turn, woadie spot 'em, peeled the car
Had a mask on, Draco make 'em beat box

[Verse 6: NLE Choppa]
Brrt, Ayy, walk 'em down straight to the ground, we make sure that he don't get up (Damn E, this shit exclusive, don't get up)
Call the reverend and his momma (Yeah, gone), tell 'em, ""Come and pick him up"" (Come and pick him up)
I'ma smack you with this .40, askin', ""Is my Glizzy tucked?"" (Is my Glizzy tucked?)
Only like it sloppy, she gon' beatbox when she suckin' me (Come here, come here)
Told her, ""Bring a friend"", if she ever think about fuckin' me
Touchin' who? Touchin' me? To God where your ass gon' be (Brrt)
Leave him stuck and send him up like he fuckin' with Cardi B (Brrt, brrt, brrt)
Park the car before we hit the street, I'm hoppin' out on feet (Better on feet)
Get up close so I can see his teeth but I'ma keep it brief
Ask do he remember me, then introduced him to my heat (Remember me?)
Skrrt off the block, you followin' this car, your whip be cream cheese (Come here, brrt)
Ain't no bush to beat around, you not duckin' no hunnid rounds (Not duckin')
Whole hood been down, fuck the count 'cause we just beat it down ('Cause we just beat it down)
Ain't gotta spin back around because my target hit the ground (My target hit the ground)
Crossed that line, you out of bounds, they gon' find you up in the crowd (No, no)
Nappy-ass dreadlocks (Ayy), black Forces, black socks (Ayy, brrt)
Make the Draco pop (Brrt), it's louder than a boombox (Brrt, brrt)
Shoutout to OVO, this Drac' can make your bed rock (Make your bed rock)
We beat them four and oh, just check the score, it say a lot (Ayy, check the score, bitch)
Ayy, I'm in Miami, she givin' me head on Ocean Drive while her nigga outside
Sucked me so good, I thought that I died
But when I nutted, I had came back alive
Skeet on her face, it got in her eyes
Now she tellin' me she legally blind
Gave her a towel and told her she fine
She kept suckin' 'til she started cryin' (Come here, come here)
Point 'em out, shoot 'em out, I spot 'em, I got 'em (Come here)
He started runnin', so I caught 'em (Ayy, ayy)
Bag on his head, I bought 'em (Ayy)
Told my shooter do everything that I taught him (Ayy)
Let me know if it's a problem
Like a school boy, I be super quick to solve it
Thinkin' my shooter retarded
He take a pill and then snort it right off of his .40
Snort it right off of his gun (No)
Shot a hunnid, then paid a hunnid for his bond (No, no)
Send a diss, I won't respond (No)
Slam dunk a nigga like a nigga was LeBron (Come here)
Leave a nigga where he stay
Same place that I met him, I made him lay (Come here, come here)
Let a nigga come and play
He gon' tell his momma, ""Plan the funeral date"" (Brrt, brrt, brrt, brrt, brrt)
I got the power like Nelson Mandela
You need a umbrella whenever I spray (Whenever I spray)
Leave him shitty like Nutella
He gon' need a Pamper if he survive this K ('Vive this, ayy)
Me and my niggas, we down for whatever
We step on whoever in retro J's (Retro J's)
Bullet, stick like a thorn, call it Bella
Make him Cinderella if he betray, bitch

[Chorus: SpotEmGottem]
Bur— Bur— Burn away a carbon beam, knock your legs off
Tried to get away from me, had a standoff
Hit him in the spine, knock his dreads off
My woadie just caught a body, I nicknamed him Randy Moss
Thuggin' in my Reeboks, riding with a G-SHOCK
Shh, I heard he shot, Draco make 'em beat box
He made that sharp turn, woadie spot 'em, peeled the car
Had a mask on, Draco make 'em beat box

[Verse 7: Pooh Shiesty]
I'm strapped up wit' this jug, one in the head, already de-cocked (It's de-cocked)
I pop out when the beef hot, won't see me creepin' on your block (Nope, nope)
I work the back seat, we went three deep and got ten people shot (Blrrrd, blrrrd)
I hit the auto-switch and made it twerk and while he dumped the Glock (Blrrrd, blrrrd)
Got the drop on all his spot, he gettin' robbed if he go or not
I know the taste and love Wock', he pourin' up in exotic pop
That booster hitter tried to pull a move and that shit got him dropped
Blrrrd, blrrrd-blrrrd, you pussies know what's up
Turn a nigga to a pack, we break 'em down and roll 'em up
Ain't shit changed but the whip, now it's a Rolls truck when I'm pulling up
And I still ain't check the time up on my Cartier, just hold it up (Blrrrd)
Don't come around acting gangster, we call your bluff (Blrrrd-blrrrd)
Put trust in these firearms, know we dangerous
If you catch me speed up, bitch, give it up or I'ma buss
We shoot your shit up on the E-Way, get out the same lane as us
Blrrrd, blrrrd-blrrrd (Same lane as us), Big Blrrrd

[Chorus: SpotemGottem & Pooh Shiesty]

[Verse 8: DDG]
Hit 'em in his spine one more time for that sweet talk
Gave my nigga some time, he was selling all that re-rock
Get him hit, he drop
""Hood Melody"", free Top
Tweet it all, post and delete
My bitch can not get over me
I be in that pussy geeked
I'm a nigga you should keep
Don't be asking who is me
Before I fuck you, Google me
Them comments don't be moving me
Fuck is they gon' do to me?
You do for me, I do for you (Yeah)
You cool with me, I'm cool with you
My momma said ""They using you, drop 'em and keep doing you""
I'm number one, they number two
My bank account gon' humble you
Took a Perc' and it ain't work, so I took two and felt like Durk
That pill make me wanna flirt
Fly a bad bitch out to Turks
Fuck her once and give her merch
Block a bitch, I bet she lurk
Hit and quit it, leave her hurt
Sometimes I feel like a jerk
She did me wrong, I did her worse
Fix it with a Louis purse
Throw the Lambo' in reverse
We skrt, uh yeah, we gon' throw the Lambo' in reverse
Throw that ass and make it twerk
We ran her, but I hit 'em first
All them bitches on The Shade Room wanna fuck me
Only if she lucky, I like sucky-sucky
They say she a ho, I don't know, but she love me
She came from Kentucky
I like how she fuck me
I like how these album sales got 'em talkin'
Bitch, I made a million off of ""Moonwalking in Calabasas""
Never bragging
I just hit this ghetto bitch, she hella ratchet
I just bought this Glock brand new it ain't got no attachments
Pew pew pew, pssht, boom boom, that bitch going off
I be in the club with hella chains on, I'm showing off
Bitch, I'm in my vibe and them comments tryna throw it off
Put a bitch on and she dipped that bitch throw the sauce

So much water on my neck, it's like I'm detoxin
Two drums and two sticks I'm beatboxin' (Grr, Hey)
I wish he would, We gon' treat top him (Pop, pop, pop)
I just blew 150 out the safe, I had to restock it (damn, damn)
Fuck a grammy I got the streets watching (streets watching)
And for my bro I wear that red until I'm dead
I know that he watching (R.i.p)
Left my ex bitch cause she toxic (Goddamn)
Got this new bitch now we toxic, Can't cap, I been toxic (Damn)
Told 'em pussy niggas keep watching (hm, hm)
Always got the .40 on me with the beam and plus I keep options (Grr, Pop)
Ready to get it started (Pop), Vv's on my chest
Now I'm cold hearted (uh), Diamonds go retarded (uh)
Living in big houses from apartments, Bitch I made it out
My money and my loyalty, Two things I’ll never play about (hm, hm)
My oppositions tryna take me out (Okay)
And I'm fucked up in the head and they gon' make me bring my brazy out
Fuck what you thought ain't shit to think about (No, no)
A Twenty pack could get him whacked, Turn my head up ""Fuck it, lay him out""
We gon' ball regardless, Twenty bottles in my section, Look like alcoholics (Ooouuu)
Free my blooder, Murder gang, I hope you beat them charges (Gang)
I be on that private plane, Champagne when we departed, OG I'm the God
So much body on this bitch can't even park it
I don't never rep my jewelry (Skrr), If I were bitch I bought it (Facs)
That's cause I could afford it (Facs)
I've been fucking up these rap beats so long, It's getting boring now
They like ""M.A how you been?"" can't even call it
I just handle business, Mind my business, Feet up in my office
Prolly counting racks out, My stacks look like math books
The money turn me on, It's just some' bout ""how that cash look""
Bad bitch she need her ass whopped (need her ass whopped)
She a pretty lil dicky, But ay lil mama ""how that bag look?""
You look good but if you're broke then, That's a bad look
Turn around, Let me get that last a look (Ooouuu)

[Verse 10: Lil Yachty]
Thuggin' in my Reeboks
Ten milli', big Glocks, huh
In a big truck, fuck around, make your ears pop
Fuck with me, gang'll do some' to you, make your tears drop
Hit 'em off, Wafi only boy, I don't Sears shop
Fuck around, might move to Michigan and get my peers hot
Trustworthy, uh, I think not, we'll wipe snot
Three lines, gon' make it look like wine in a clear pot
Ride around with the same weapon, ain't get deer shot
No rearviews in my life, leave that shit behind me
I was only eighteen years old when Kanye tried to sign me
Niggas gangsters online 'til you see 'em named Mahatma Gandhi
Better tell my bitch, ""Let's get a bitch that's tatted like Kehlani""
If she tell me yes, I'll let you know the when and where's to find me
Niggas already thinkin' that they wildin', steady tryna guide me
Finna blind me, standin' in my way, they need to get behind me
Every day I ride with a rocket just like my first name Johnny
White diamonds got more colors than a Murakami
Bitch thought I was Japanese, I folded just like origami
Used to sleep in front of Shoney's, now I got an eighty-inch Sony
Rich as hell, used to be broke, fucked up, eatin' bologna
Niggas not like us, we get to the money
How the fuck we wipe his nose and we still left it runnin'?
How you fly with nothin' to your name? Man, you niggas bummin'
'Member tryna get kids to game, they ain't listen to me

Laugh Now Cry Later,Drake Featuring Lil Durk,"TranslationsРусскийLaugh Now Cry Later Lyrics[Intro: Drake]
Woah, woah
Yeah

[Chorus: Drake]
Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby
Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?

[Verse 1: Drake]
Tired of beefin' you bums, you can't even pay me enough to react
Been wakin' up in the crib and sometimes I don't even know where I'm at
Please don't play that nigga songs in this party, I can't even listen to that
Anytime that I ran into somebody, it must be a victory lap, ayy
Shawty, come sit on my lap, ayy, they sayin' Drizzy just snap
Distance between us is not like a store, this isn't a closeable gap, ayy
I've seen some niggas attack and don't end up makin' it back

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
I know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad
What they had didn't last, damn, baby

[Chorus: Drake]
Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby

Point at the nigga who act like a killer, but you only one from the 'net
I'm like DaBaby, I'm not just a rapper, you play with me, you gon' get stretched
Ooh-oh
Bring Drake to the hood, surround Drake around Dracs
Even though I got a case, I'ma do what it take
And I never been embraced
And the money's hard to make
So I bet they on they face right now

[Verse 3: Drake]
When he tell the story, that's not how it went
Know they be lyin', a hundred percent
Moved out the Ritz and forgot 'bout the Bent'
Valet just called me to tell me come get it
Knocked that boy off and I don't want no credit
If it was me, they wouldn't regret it
Left me for dead and now they wan' dead it, yeah
Heart is still beatin', my niggas still eatin'
Backyard, it look like the Garden of Eden
Pillow talk with 'em, she spillin' the tea
And then shawty came back and said she didn't mean it
It's hard to believe it

Yeah

[Verse 1: Drake]
Leave me out the comments, leave me out the nonsense
Speakin' out of context, people need some content
Niggas tryna keep up, shit is not a contest
Whippin' Benz concept
Heaven-sent, God-sent
Least that's what my mom says
Proof is in the progress, money's not a object
Busy than a motherfucker, you know how my job get
Barkin' up the wrong tree, you know how the dogs get
Haven't fallen off yet, yee
Come with a classic, they come around years later and say it's a sleeper
The earrings are real, the petty is real, might charge my ex for a feature
Deposit the money to Brenda, LaTisha, or Linda, Felicia
She came for me twice, I didn't even nut for her once, you know I'm a pleaser
Forty-two millimeter, was made in Geneva
Yeah, I probably should go to Yeshiva, we went to Ibiza
Yeah, I probably should go link with Yeezy, I need me some Jesus

Should repent, I need me some Jesus in my life

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
I'm from the four, but I love me a threesome
DM her, delete it, she my lil' secret
He tryna diss me to blow up, I peep it
I can't respond, we just go at your people
If I left some racks on the bed, you can keep it
This shit gettin' deeper and deeper, I dig it
My shovel wasn't bent, I was broke, had to fix it
A shark in the water, you swim with the lil' fishes
I hit today, by tomorrow, she miss it
I grab her neck, she look up, then I kiss it
I'm not a GOAT, but I fit the description
I like to pour, so I get the prescription
We walk around with them bands in our britches
This gun ain't gon' jam, when I blow, I ain't missin'
I'm droppin' hit after hit, I'm just chillin'
But I'll send a hit while I chill with my children
Bigger the business, the bigger the office
I fucked 'round and found me a swag, then I caught up
They call for my artists, they makin' me offers
I don't even bargain, I'll start from the bottom
I lost a Ferrari, Las Vegas, Nevada
I woke up the followin' day and went harder
I'm crackin' my shell now, they see that I'm smarter
I gotta get money, I love to get charter
I gave her four Birkins and one's for her daughter
I can't let 'em down, walk around with my guard up
I'm screamin' out ""YOLO,"" yeah, that's still the motto
I know I be on some shit that they ain't thought of

[Coro]
Quién lo diría que se podría
Hacer el amor por telepatía
La luna está llena, mi cama vacía
Lo que yo te haría
Si te tuviera de frente, la mente te la volaría
De noche y de día, de noche y de día

[Verso 1]
You know I'm just a flight away
If you want it, you could take a private plane
A kilómetros estamos conectando
Y me prendes aunque no me estés tocando
You know I got a lot to say
All these voices in the background of my brain
Y me dicen todo lo que estás pensando
Me imagino lo que ya estás maquinando

[Coro]
Quién lo diría que se podría
Hacer el amor por telepatía
La luna está llena, mi cama vacía
Lo que yo te haría
Si te tuviera de frente, la mente te la volaría
De noche y de día, de noche y de día

'Cause I can read your mind, I can read your mind
I can hear your thoughts like a melody
Listen while you talk when you're fast asleep
You stay on the phone just to hear me breathe

You can have your bitch back, she a groupie
She just swallowed all my kids in the two-seat (Gag)
Swagged out
For Milly, we bringing them gats out
I still got some racks stuffed in the trap house
