Yeah

[Verse 1]
I've been tryna call
I've been on my own for long enough
Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe
I'm going through withdrawals
You don't even have to do too much
You can turn me on with just a touch, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
I look around and
Sin City's cold and empty (Oh)
No one's around to judge me (Oh)
I can't see clearly when you're gone

[Chorus]
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
Hey, hey, hey

[Verse 2]
I'm running out of time
'Cause I can see the sun light up the sky
So I hit the road in overdrive, baby, oh

No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust

[Bridge]
I'm just calling back to let you know (Back to let you know)
I could never say it on the phone (Say it on the phone)
Will never let you go this time (Ooh)

[Chorus]
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey

[Verse 1]
We couldn't turn around 'til we were upside down
I'll be the bad guy now, but know I ain't too proud
I  couldn't be there even when I tried
You  don't believe it, we do this every time

[Chorus]
Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed  the flame 'cause we can't let go
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away
I dare you to do something
I'm  waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away

[Verse 2]
Let go, I got a feeling that it's time to let go
I said so, I knew that this was doomed from the get-go
You thought that it was special, special
But it was just the sex though, the sex though
And I still hear the echoes (The echoes)
I got a feeling that it's time to let it go, let it go

Maybe you don't understand what I'm going through
It's only me, what you got to lose?
Make up your mind, tell me, what are you gonna do?
It's only me, let it go

Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed the flame 'cause we can't let go

I won't never sell my soul, and I can back that
And I really wanna know where you at, at

[Verse 1]
I was out back where the stash at
Cruise the city in a bulletproof Cadillac (Skrrt)
'Cause I know these niggas after where the bag at (Yeah)
Gotta move smarter, gotta move harder
Nigga try to get me for my water
I'll lay his ass down, on my son, on my daughter
I had the Draco with me, Dwayne Carter
Lotta niggas out here playin', ain't ballin'
I done put my whole arm in the rim, Vince Carter (Yeah)
And I know probably get a key for the quarter
Shawty barely seen in double C's, I bought 'em

If you don't wanna see me

[Verse 1]
Did a full one-eighty, crazy
Thinking 'bout the way I was
Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe
But look at where I ended up
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so

[Pre-Chorus]
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me

[Chorus]
Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now

[Verse 2]
Aren't you the guy who tried to
Hurt me with the word ""goodbye""?
Though it took some time to survive you
I'm better on the other side
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary

We took a hard left, but we're alright
Yeah, life sure can try to put love through it, but
We built this right, so nothing's ever gonna move it

When the bones are good, the rest don't matter
Yeah, the paint could peel, the glass could shatter
Let it rain 'cause you and I remain the same
When there ain't a crack in the foundation
Baby, I know any storm we're facing
Will blow right over while we stay put
The house don't fall when the bones are good

Call it dumb luck, but baby, you and I
Can't even mess it up, yeah, though we both tried
No, it don't always go the way we planned it
But the wolves came and went and we're still standing

I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy

Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

[Verse 2]
I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you

I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape

Tornato con il remix
Questi ragazzi tutti miei figli come Phoenix (Pooh, you a fool for this one)
La mia città e il mio stato non hanno mai visto questo
Jimmy Neutron, sono un ragazzo prodigio (Oh Lord, Jetson made another one)
Sul futon, le sto dando quel cazzo
Quando questa merda è pronta, I'ma fill up arenas
Ooh, come Gilbert Arenas, sparo il colpo
Sono ancora con i demoni, ooh, I keep it thorough
Ho cinque tipe a New York
Questo significa una in ogni quartiere
Sono nel pocket come Burrow
Quando sono tornato a casa, though
Mi trattano come Robert De Niro
La ho portata Taco Bell, le ho comprato un churro
La ho portata a casa, le ho dato un cinnamon swirl
I left it in, now I got a one-year old
Zeri su zeri su zeri (Zeri)
Quello è cosa il bilancio del mio conto bancario dice (Woo)
Ho a check dalla compagnia di scarpe
Ora faccio qualsiasi cosa che dice New Balance
Le ho comprato un biglietto aereo, fuori di stato
I got me a shorty from 'round the way
Ho detto, ""Sono in città oggi""
Lei ha detto che she comin' over and she down to stay
I got a hit, she been playin' quella merda
Così quando she pull up on me so cosa she 'bout to say

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
Not what you'd think
And if I'm bein' honest
It might've been a nightmare
To anyone who might care
Thought I could fly (Fly)
So I stepped off the Golden, mm
Nobody cried (Cried, cried, cried, cried)
Nobody even noticed
I saw them standing right there
Kinda thought they might care (Might care, might care)

[Pre-Chorus]
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

[Chorus]
And you say, ""As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'""

I tried to scream
But my head was underwater
They called me weak
Like I'm not just somebody's daughter
Coulda been a nightmare
But it felt like they were right there
And it feels like yesterday was a year ago
But I don't wanna let anybody know
'Cause everybody wants something from me now
And I don't wanna let 'em down

[Pre-Chorus]
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

And you say, ""As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'""

If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
What would they say instead?

Well, time can heal but this won't

Was there something I could've said
To make your heart beat better?

So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless

Went little by little by little until there was nothing at all

All this money and this pain got me heartless

Catch a little air when we cross the tracks

Slipping through the moon to the river bend
Wasn't very long I was jumping in, jumping in
I guess I'm still doing now what I was doing then

Burning going down, burning going down
Chasin' you like those goodbye tail lights
Headed west to anywhere out of this nowhere town
Chasin' that freedom, chasing' that feeling that got gone too soon
Chasin' that you and me, I only see in my rearview
Yeah, I'm laying here tonight holding someone new
Still chasin' you, still chasin' you

When you kiss me, I know you don't give two fucks
But I still want that

Thought I could be single forever 'til I met you
Usually don't be fallin', be fallin', fallin' fast
You got a way of keepin' me comin' back-to-back
I just found out, the only reason that you lovin' me
Was to get back at your ex lover but before you leave

My name is Devvon Terrell
This is a raw session
You know the vibes

[Verse: Devvon Terrell]
Trips that you plan for the next whole week
Bands too long for a nigga so cheap
And your flex OD, and your sex OD
You got it, girl, you got it (Oh)
Oh lemme tell you
You got it, girl, you got it
You should deal with a five star nigga
Know you work more than just 6 figures
I'm applying the pressure my finger on the trigger
I know you got a roster just full of hittas
But you need a first line up like Kawhi to the Clippers
Been through so much shit that you don't even know the difference
Made so many mental notes that you can't save a picture
Got so many cuts and bruises I was still invested
Still treat you like the best like KD to the Nets

[Bridge: Devvon Terrell]
I see you and I know you legit (Yeah)
High off you, I need a fix (Yeah)
You a hot girl I'm off this lukewarm
That's like comparing you to a groupon chile

Running 'round in yellow green and blue
Why you always such a noob
Walking round, acting brand new
I don't wanna see you yelling oof
But you ain't got a clue
Afk and lagging out too
Running 'round in yellow green and blue
Now i'm on the golden gun
Going for that arsenal dub
Somehow never got my builder's club
Newbie, i'm not an oder
Won't you ever understand
I only simp for builderman
Boy it's obvious that you're such a noob
Laggy internet that you barely move
And you love dying in murder mystery 2
Now i'm tired of you acting so confused
We play games we love and have fun with our free time
We've fallen before but we laugh in the meantime
Why you always such a noob

So why's it saying you're online but you don't show up
We could stick to playing the blox as we grow up
If i could then i would give you all my robux
But i'm sorry i can only give you bobux
I'm talking anthro
Arsenal, winning every bloxy
Finding every key to escape from the piggy
Got a tycoon, now i'm spitting out money
Got a simulator full of bees making honey
We play games we love and have fun with our free time
We've fallen before but we laugh in the meantime
Why you always such a noob
Walking round, acting brand new
I don't wanna see you yelling oof
But you ain't got a clue
Afk and lagging out too
Running 'round in yellow green and blue
Why you always such a noob
Walking round, acting brand new

Если я сказал тебе раз, то я не повторюсь дважды
Я очень осторожный, как вор в ночи (Смотри)

[Куплет 1: Pop Smoke]
Если я зову тебя деткой, то ты детка на день
Или детка на ночь, ты не моя жена
Она хочет убийцу, чтобы трахаться всю ночь
Я хочу трахаться с тати, соси мне всю ночь

[Куплет 2: Lil Baby]
Я богатый, но я катаюсь, у меня мало экзотики, я должен вылететь и получить немного
Ничего не видел, все эти деньги на мне, сотня пачек в сумке, это медовая булочка
Baby OG, я бегал по этим улицам, получил игру из Lashawn
Я сын своей мамы
Выучил о тройном кресте, когда был молодым и я знаю, что не пойду, так что я держу пушку
Я полетел в Париж просто, чтобы купить Dior
Она просит внимания, я не вижу её
C.I.P Pop, я хочу, чтобы ты мог увидеть нас
Я и Cash плюс кто бы то ни был, я иду снова
У получил ниггеров на улице, не побьёшь меня
Я получил индустрию, пытаешься быть мной
Я просто Рэй Чарльз, они не могут увидеть меня
Я в Rolls-Royce с RiRi

[Куплет 3: DaBaby & Pop Smoke]
Как вор в ночи (Вор)
Я подъехал, дал ей D на ночь (Ах-хах)
Пытаюсь потрахаться в V, это хорошо (Давай трахаться)
Мы не можем испачкать мои сиденья, потому что они белые (Это мои сиденья, смотри на мои сиденья)
Я живу, как в ""Thriller"", я выхожу только ночью
Она не трахается с ликёром, не любит быть выпившей
Она не пьёт Henny, только белое вино (Что она делает?)
Открыл пробку в новом Pinot Grigio (Да)
Подъехал на Porsche с причудливой шлюхой (Зум)
Паркую Porsche и подъезжаю на Lambo (Хмф)
Я выпрыгиваю, Майор Пейн, раскачиваю камуфляж (Да сэр)
Думаю она милая, заставляю её трахаться, дай её мужчине идти (Она милая)
Люблю стрелять, зажигать тебя, сука, я Рембо
Кубинская ссылка полна камней, это чокер (Ох)
Покойся с миром Pop, заставь меня скурить тебя

Я сделал что-то не так (О-о), но я всегда прав (О-о)
