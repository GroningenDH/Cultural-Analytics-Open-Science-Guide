I found a love for me
Oh, darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight

[Verse 2]
Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own

[Pre-Chorus]
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you

Thinking of you in my bed
You were my everything
Thoughts of a wedding ring
Now I'm just better off dead (Uh, uh, uh)

I didn't want it to end
I watch it blow in the wind
I should've listened to my friends

I was uptight, wanna let loose

My head in a hoodie, my shorty a goodie
My cousins are crazy, my cousins like Boogie
Life is amazin', it is what it should be
Been here for ten but I feel like a rookie
I tell her, ""Look up"" 'cause it's snowin' in Tootsie's
Booked for three years, man, you can't even book me
It's me and Lil Baby, this shit goin' crazy
Wheezy produced it and Weezy F. made me
And she held it down, so she got a Mercedes
Young Money Records, the Army, the Navy
They ran me ten thousand, I threw it like Brady
The foreign is yellow like Tracee and K.D
I trusted my niggas, they never betrayed me
Met all these niggas, they sweeter than Sadie
When I started out, I just took what they gave me
Did all the favors, they never repaid me
It worked in my favor, 'cause nobody saved me

Ah, du hast die Richtige
L-Lass es diese-l-lass es diese S-S-Schlampen wissen, Nigga
Queens, Brooklyn, prr, ah!
Murda on the beat so it's not nice!

[Part 1: 6ix9ine]
Muschi ist nass, nass, und es tropft, tropft
Ist eine Spritzpistole, fick sie, sie ist ein Fefe
Ihr Name Keke, sie bläst meinen Schwanz als sei er gratis, gratis
Ich weiß noch nicht einmal, so „Wieso habe ich das getan?“
Ich weiß noch nicht einmal, so „Wieso habe ich sie gefickt?“
Ich weiß nur, dass ich sie nicht zu meiner Frau machen kann
Bin nett zu ihr, damit sie sich nicht wehrt
Drehe um und fick es von hinten, hinten, hinten
Beuge sie runter und lass es klatschen, klatschen, klatschen

[Hook: 6ix9ine]
Ich will nicht wirklich Freunde
Ich will nicht wirklich Freunde, nein

Draco hat den Rückstoß, wenn ich schieße, werden sie zu Leichtathleten
Sie schießen nicht zurück, ein Schuss, Nahdistanz, roter Punkt
Kopf platzt, ja, ich hab's getan, ja, das ist mein Leben

Hält meine Muschi in Versace, sagte ich bin schön so wie Tinashe
Halt-Halte es alles in sein Gesicht, wurde ich angeklagt?
Soeben ist jemand meinem Pussy-Game erlitten, doch ich hinterlasse nie eine Spur
Gesicht so schön, Arsch langt für Tage, ich bekomme Chips, ich frage nach Lay's
Ich lehne mich nur zurück, wenn er fertig ist und frage, „Wie hat es geschmeckt?“

At the gate outside, when they pull up, they get me loose
Yeah, Jump Out boys, that's Nike boys, hoppin' out coupes
This shit way too big, when we pull up, give me the loot (Gimme the loot!)
Was off the Remy, had a Papoose
Had to hit my old town to duck the news
Two-four hour lockdown, we made no moves
Now it's 4 AM and I'm back up poppin' with the crew
I just landed in, Chase B mixes pop like Jamba Juice
Different colored chains, think my jeweler really sellin' fruits
And they chokin', man, know the crackers wish it was a noose

She said, ""Where we goin'?"" I said, ""The moon""
We ain't even make it to the room

Now I got her open, it's just the Goose

Hit it, no rubber never would let no one touch her
Swear we drive each other mad, she be so stubborn
But, what the fuck is love with no pain, no suffer?

Ever tell you different, then it's a lie
See, that's my down bitch, see that's my soldier

We do drugs together (Together), fuck up clubs together (Together)
And we'd both go crazy (Crazy) if we was to sever
You know?
We keep mobbin', it's just me and my bitch
Fuck the world, we just gon' keep getting rich, you know?
[Chorus: Halsey]
Cross my heart, hope to die
To my lover, I'd never lie
He said ""be true,"" I swear I'll try
In the end, it's him and I
He's out his head, I'm out my mind
We got that love; the crazy kind
I am his, and he is mine
In the end, it's him and I

Cross my heart, hope to die to you, I've never lied
For you, I'd take a life, it's him and I, and I swear (Ayy)
'Til the end I'ma ride wit' you
Mob and get money, get high wit' you, yeah (Ayy)
Cross my heart, hope to die, this is our ride or die
You can confide in me, there's not no hiding, I swear
Stay solid, never lie to you
Swear, most likely I'ma die wit' you, yeah
[Chorus: Halsey]
Cross my heart, hope to die
To my lover, I'd never lie
He said, “Be true,” I swear I'll try
In the end, it's him and I

In My Blood,Shawn Mendes,"In My Blood Lyrics[Intro]
Help me, it's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But I just can't
It isn't in my blood

[Verse 1]
Laying on the bathroom floor, feeling nothing
I'm overwhelmed and insecure, give me something
I could take to ease my mind slowly
Just have a drink and you'll feel better
Just take her home and you'll feel better
Keep telling me that it gets better
Does it ever?

[Pre-Chorus]
Help me, it's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
No medicine is strong enough
Someone help me
I'm crawling in my skin
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But I just can't

[Chorus]
It isn't in my blood
It isn't in my blood

Love, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you? (Haunt)
I know the feeling haunt you (Haunt)

This may be the night that my dreams might let me know

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Tell me what you gon' do to me
Confrontation ain't nothin' new to me
You can bring a bullet, bring a sword, bring a morgue
But you can't bring the truth to me
Fuck you and all your expectations
I don't even want your congratulations
I recognize your false confidence
And calculated promises all in your conversation
I hate people that feel entitled
Look at me crazy 'cause I didn't invite you
Oh, you important?
You the moral to the story? You endorsin'?
Mothafucka, I don't even like you
Corrupted man's heart with a gift
That's how you find out who you dealin' with
A small percentage who I'm buildin' with
I want the credit if I'm losin' or I'm winnin'
On my momma, that's the realest shit

[Verse 2: SZA]
It's getting cold when an ego gets to talkin'
I get involved, like a rebound
No control, no, I'm switched in the way that you're bringin' me down
It's a turn on, you didn't wait from me
Leave me alone, keep away from me
And it sound wrong, get it away from me, yeah
I just cry for no reason
I just pray for no reason
I just think for the life, for the days
For the hours and another like breathin'
I did it all 'cause it feel good
You'd leave it all if it feel bad
Better live your life
We were runnin' out of time
[Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar, Both & SZA]

You must think that I'm a fool
You must think that I'm new to this
But I have seen this all before

I'm never gonna let you close to me
Even though you mean the most to me
'Cause every time I open up, it hurts
So I'm never gonna get too close to you
Even when I mean the most to you
In case you go and leave me in the dirt

[Chorus]
But every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out, the less I love you
Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true
I'm way too good at goodbyes

I'm way too good at goodbyes

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
Puts, amor ou luxúria
Puts, tudo de nós

[Refrão: Zacari & Kendrick Lamar]
Venham competir comigo
Não há ninguém, ninguém me ultrapassa (outra estreia mundial)
Então se atrevam a competir comigo
Tô bebendo champagne, me sentindo adorável
Vivendo adoravelmente, só me ame
Eu quero estar com você, ei, quero estar
Somente me ame, só me ame, só ame
Eu quero estar com você, ei, quero estar
Só me ame
Eu quero estar com você
Me ame, só me ame

[Pós-Refrão: Kendrick Lamar & Zacari]
Se eu não dirigisse carros de luxo, você ainda me amaria?
Se eu minimizasse meu patrimônio, você ainda me amaria?
Sou sincero, prefiro que você confie em mim do que me ame
Sou completamente sincero, sem você, não tenho nada

[Verso 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Ei, eu tenho algo, calma aí
Vamos festejar, sem suposições
Me sentindo como Tyson
Fodendo duas vezes pra valer
Tô nisso só por uma noite, é brincadeira
Isso é pra vida, yeah, cê é uma parceira pra vida inteira
É uma parceira pra vida inteira, bora
Deite sua cabeça no meu ombro
Eu sei o que esse ""vem aqui em casa"" significa
Atravessaria o mar nadando por você
Eu sei do que você precisa
Já se foram dez anos que nossa grana tá chegando
Todo sentimento acaba, esse sentimento não seca
Essa festa não vai acabar

Falando besteira pelo caminho (me ame)
Eu tô no caminho?
Eu não quero pressionar você
Quero sua benção hoje (me ame)
Ah, a propósito, abra a porta
Te disse que estou a caminho
Tô a caminho, eu sei que a conexão está fraca
Atenda minha ligação, amor
Caramba, nós arrasamos, essa atitude má vem da sua avó
E essas curvas e o quadril, da sua mãe
Lembre-se de Gardena, eu levei a câmera do estúdio
Eu sei que Top vai ficar bolado comigo
Eu tive que fazer isso, eu quero seu corpo, sua música
Eu comprei um anel dos grandes pra provar isso
Olha o que cê faz, te disse que tô a caminho
Eu tô a uma rua de distância, yeah
