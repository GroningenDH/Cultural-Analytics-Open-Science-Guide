In the cold light of day, we're a flame in the wind
Not the fire that we've begun
Every argument, every word we can't take back
'Cause with all that has happened
I think that we both know the way that this story ends

Far away from the wreck we made

But you need a first line up like Kawhi to the Clippers

Got so many cuts and bruises I was still invested
Still treat you like the best like KD to the Nets

You good, T-Minus?

[Refrain]
Niggas been countin' me out
I’m countin' my bullets, I'm loadin’ my clips
I'm writin' down names, I'm makin' a list
I'm checkin' it twice and I'm gettin’ ’em hit
The real ones been dyin', the fake ones is lit
The game is off balance, I’m back on my shit
The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty
But that's how I like it, you all on my dick

[Verse 1]
I'm all in my bag, this hard as it get
I do not snort powder, I might take a sip
I might hit the blunt, but I'm liable to trip
I ain’t poppin' no pill, but you do as you wish
I roll with some fiends, I love 'em to death
I got a few mil' but not all of them rich
What good is the bread if my niggas is broke?
What good is first class if my niggas can't sit?
That's my next mission, that's why I can't quit
Just like LeBron, get my niggas more chips
Just put the Rollie right back on my wrist
This watch came from Drizzy, he gave me a gift
Back when the rap game was prayin' I'd diss
They act like two legends cannot coexist
But I'd never beef with a nigga for nothin'
If I smoke a rapper, it's gon' be legit
It won't be for clout, it won't be for fame
It won't be 'cause my shit ain't sellin' the same
It won't be to sell you my latest lil' sneakers
It won't be 'cause some nigga slid in my lane
Everything grows, it's destined to change
I love you lil' niggas, I'm glad that you came
I hope that you scrape every dollar you can
I hope you know money won't erase the pain
To the OGs, I'm thankin' you now
Was watchin' you when you was pavin' the ground
I copied your cadence, I mirrored your style
I studied the greats, I'm the greatest right now
Fuck if you feel me, you ain't got a choice
I ain't do no promo, still made all that noise
This year gon' be different, I set my intentions
I promise to slap all that hate out your voice

Reminded me of young niggas from 'Ville
Straight out the projects, no fakin', just honest
I wish that he had more guidance, for real
Too many niggas in cycle of jail
Spending they birthdays inside of a cell
We coming from a long bloodline of trauma
We raised by our mamas, Lord, we gotta heal
We hurting our sisters, the babies as well
We killing our brothers, they poisoned the well
Distorted self-image, we set up to fail

I bought a new Patek, I had the watch, so I two-toned 'em
Takin' these drugs, I'm gon' be up until the mornin'
That ain't your car, you just a leaser, you don't own it

I know they hatin' on me, but I don't read comments
Whenever I tell her to come, she comin'
Whenever it's smoke, we ain't runnin'

And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug

I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you

It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape

E estamos fora nessas ruas (Tudo bem)

Abaixei o teto, mais expansão
Dirija um carro em que você possa ficar (It's lit)
Vejo as vadias cobertas (Nos lençóis)
Eu sou um amante de bundas e peitos (Bunda grande)
Acho que todos nós fizemos um pro outro
Agora que todos os parças estão livres (Yeah, yeah)
E estamos fora nessas ruas (Tudo bem)
Você pode fazer isso, você pode rebolar pra mim?

Entrando em um Demon, por Deus (Por Deus)

Voando no jato particular com uma arma (Arma)

[Verso 2: Kodak Black]
Em um Hellcat porque eu fui criado no inferno
Homem feito, eu não devo favor pra nenhum mano
Quando você conseguir esse dinheiro, mano, mantenha seu coração
Eu tô deslizando no carro, não precisa de chave pra ligar
Eu levo a arma comigo no BET Awards
Quando seu poço secar, você sabe que precisa de mim pra isso
Quando eu estaciono no Buick, você sabe o que tô fazendo
Se a polícia ficar atrás de mim, eu vou fugir e vazar
Dormindo na paleta me transformou em um selvagem
Eu sou um bebê do projeto, agora moro em Calabasas
Como se eu ainda servisse aos demônios, como se ainda estivesse afirmando
Eu tô bebendo lean, tento manter o equilíbrio
Andando naquela Z-Walk, Dickie's com meus Reeboks
Eu não falo muito, apenas deixo a arma falar
Suas joias mexem na água, diamantes tipo re-rock
Minha mina cavalga no pau como se tivesse numa gangorra
Quando eu entrei na cena, eu tava com uma mira
Quando eu entrei na Beam', eu tava de Celine
Garotinha, você é apenas uma aventura, não é isso que quero dizer
Dinheiro pulando pra fora do meu jeans, igual eu faço o esquema

You knew all my uncles and my aunts though
Twenty candles, blow 'em out and open your eyes
We were lookin' forward to the rest of our lives
Used to keep my picture posted by your bedside
Now it's in your dresser with the socks you don't like
And I'm rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
With my brothers like it's Jonas, Jonas
Drinkin' Henny and I'm tryna forget
But I can't get this shit outta my head

[Verse 1: Drake]
I mean, where the fuck should I really even start?
I got hoes that I'm keepin' in the dark
I got my niggas 'cross the street livin' large
Thinkin' back to the fact that they dead
Thought my raps wasn't facts 'til they sat with the bars
I got two phones, one need a charge
Yeah, they twins, I could tell they ass apart
I got big packs comin' on the way
I got big stacks comin' out the safe
I got Lil Max with me, he the wave
It's a big gap between us in the game
In the next life, I'm tryna stay paid
When I die, put my money in the grave

[Chorus: Drake]
When I die, put my money in the grave
I really gotta put a couple niggas in they place
Really just lapped every nigga in the race
I really might tat ""Realest Nigga"" on my face
Lil CC let it slap with the bass
I used to save hoes with a mask and a cape
Now I'm like, ""Nah, love, I'm good, go away""

Niggas ain't really big as they seem (Hmm)
I never say anything (Nah), everybody got they thing (True)
Some niggas make millions, other niggas make memes (Hmm)
I'm on a money routine
I don't want smoke, I want cream
I don't want no more comparisons
This is a marathon and I’m aware
I been playing it back from a lack of promotions
I never was one for the bragging and boasting
I guess I was hoping the music would speak for itself, but the people want everything else
Okay, no problem, I’ll show up on everyone album
You know what the outcome will be
I'm batting a thousand
It’s got to the point that these rappers don't even like rappin' with me
Fuck it 'cause my nigga 21 Savage just hit me
And told me he saved me a spot on a new record he got
He call it ""a lot,"" I open my book and I jot
Pray for Tekashi, they want him to rot
I picture him inside a cell on a cot
’Flectin' on how he made it to the top
Wondering if it was worth it or not
I pray for Markelle 'cause they fucked up his shot
Just want you to know that you got it, my nigga
Though I never met you, I know that you special
And that the Lord blessed you, don't doubt it, my nigga
Dennis Smith, Jr., stay solid, my nigga
I'm on a tangent, not how I planned it
I had some fans that hopped and abandoned ship
When they thought that I wasn't gon' pan out, I got a plan
They say that success is the greatest revenge, tell all your friends
Cole on a mission, cementin' the spot as the greatest that did it
Before it all ends, nigga
[Chorus: 21 Savage]

We ain't aimin' for your body, shots hit your brain
We come from poverty, man, we ain't have a thing
It's a lot of animosity, but they won't say my name
Them killers rock with me, lil' nigga, don’t get banged
’Cause they'll do that job for me while I hop on a plane

[Verse 1: Polo G]
She don’t like her body, left the doctor with a new shape
Blowing up my phone 'cause she just see me with my new bae
Heartbreaker, ladies love me like I'm Cool J
She was tryna cling onto a nigga, but it's too late
Booked a flight to Cali, racks and condoms in my suitcase
And every single dollar in these bands got a blue face
Diamonds in the Rollie, they in HD like it’s Blu-Ray
The way that I been ballin' should make the cover of 2K
Show out for the summer I might pull up in a new Wraith
Dissin' on the gang that's gon' only get your crew chased
And we hawk shit down, better tighten' up yo' shoe lace

Lost my brother, seen him die and I just seen him graduate (I just seen him graduate)
Got that .40 on my side and I'm just rollin' past the jakes (I'm just rollin' past jakes)

[Chorus]
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one

Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one

You left me falling and landing inside my grave
I know that you want me dead
I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay
I know it's all in my head
I have these lucid dreams where I can't move a thing
Thinking of you in my bed
You were my everything
Thoughts of a wedding ring
Now I'm just better off dead (Uh, uh, uh)
I'll do it over again
I didn't want it to end
I watch it blow in the wind
I should've listened to my friends
Leave this shit in the past, but I want it to last

I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?

Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
[Outro]
Leave this shit in the past, but I want it to last
You were made outta plastic, fake
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?
Easier said than done, I thought you were—
—instead of my head
You found another— better one
I won't let you forget me519Embed"

Beautiful People,Ed Sheeran Featuring Khalid,"TranslationsEnglishFrançaisNederlandsEd Sheeran - Beautiful People ft. Khalid (ترجمه ی فارسی) Lyrics[Intro: Ed Sheeran]
We are, we are, we are
ما هستیم، هستیم، هستیم ...
[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran]
L.A. on a Saturday night in the summer
توی لس آنجلس و شب شنبه چله ی تابستون
Sundown and they all come out
خورشید غروب میکنه و همه میریزن بیرون
Lamborghinis and their rented Hummers
با لامبورگینی ها و هامر های اجاره شدشون
The party's on, so they're headin' downtown ('Round here)
پارتی شروع میشه، پس اونا دارن میان سمت مرکز شهر (دور و بر اینجا)
Everybody's lookin' for a come up
همه دنبال اینن که سریعتر آماده بشن و برسن به پارتی (ایهام، همه دنبال طلوع و روشنایی خورشید میگردن)
And they wanna know what you're about
و اونا میخوان بدونن که نظر تو چیه
Me in the middle with the one I love and
من و کسی که دوسش دارم وسطای راهیم و ...
We're just tryna figure everything out
فقط داریم تلاش میکنیم که از همه چی سر در بیاریم

[Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
We don't fit in well 'cause we are just ourselves
خوب با همدیگه کنار نمیایم چونکه ما فقط خودمونیم
I could use some help gettin' out of this conversation, yeah
میتونستم یه ذره کمگ بگیرم که از این بحث و جدل بکشیم بیرون، آره
You look stunning, dear, so don't ask that question here
خیلی خوشگل شدی(به نظر میای)، عزیزم، پس دیگه اون سوالو اینجا نپرس
This is my only fear: that we become
تنها ترسم اینه که: بشیم مثل ....

Beautiful people
آدمای خوشگل
Drop top, designer clothes
با ماشینای بدون سقفشون، و لباسای مارک دارشون
Front row at fashion shows
توی ردیف جلویی نمایش مد (فشن شو) میشینن
""What d'you do?"" and ""Who d'you know?""
چی کار میکنی؟ و چی میدونی؟
Inside the world of beautiful people
توی دنیای آدمای خوشگل
Champagne and rolled-up notes
شامپاین میزنیم و پولای رول شده رو آماده میکنیم
Prenups and broken homes
توافقای قبل از ازدواج و زوج هایی که از همدیگه طلاق گرفتن
Surrounded, but still alone
کلی آدم دور و برمونه، اما هنوزم تنهایییم
Let's leave the party
بیا این پارتی رو ول کنیم بریم

[Post-Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
That's not who we are (We are, we are, we are)
این رفتار اون کسی که هستیم نیستش (ما هستیم، هستیم، هستیم)
We are not beautiful
ما خوشگل (پولدار) نیستیم
Yeah, that's not who we are (We are, we are, we are)
اره، این رفتار اون کسی که هستیم نیستش (ما هستیم، هستیم، هستیم)
We are not beautiful (Beautiful)
ما خوشگل (پولدار) نیستیم (خوشگل)
[Verse 2: Khalid]
L.A., mmm, drove for hours last night and we made it nowhere (Nowhere, nowhere)
توی لس آنجلس، ممم، برای چند ساعت آخر شب رانندگی کردیم و به هیچ جا نرسیدیم (هیچ جا، هیچ جا)
I see stars in your eyes when we're halfway there (All night)
ستاره هارو توی چشمات میبینم وقتی نصف راهو تا اونجا میریم (تموم شب)
I'm not fazed by all them lights and flashin' cameras
من با همه ی چراغاشون و فلش دوربیناشون به هم ریخته نمیشم (حواسم از تو پرت نمیشه)
'Cause with my arms around you, there's no need to care
چونکه با دستایی که تورو بغل کردن، دیگه نیازی به اهمیت دادن به اونا ندارم

[Pre-Chorus: Khalid]
We don't fit in well, we are just ourselves
خوب با همدیگه کنار نمیایم چونکه ما فقط خودمونیم
I could use some help gettin' out of this conversation, yeah
میتونستم یه ذره کمگ بگیرم که از این بحث و جدل بکشیم بیرون، آره
You look stunning, dear, so don't ask that question here
