(Last night, all I think about is you)

(Don't want, baby, think about you)
(You know that I'm never gonna lose)
Road shimmer wigglin' the vision

Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

[Verse 1]
Usually, I put somethin' on TV
So we never think about you and me
But today, I see our reflections clearly
In Hollywood, layin' on the screen
You just need a better life than this
You need somethin' I can never give
Fake water all across the road
It's gone now, the night has come, but

Can't make you happier now

[Verse 2]
You can't fight it, you can't breathe
You say somethin' so lovin', but
Now I gotta let you go
You'll be better off in someone new
I don't wanna be alone
You know it hurts me too
You look so broken when you cry
One more and then I say goodbye

[Chorus]
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
[Bridge]
I just wonder what you're dreamin' of
When you sleep and smile so comfortable
I just wish that I could give you that
That look that's perfectly un-sad
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Heat waves been fakin' me out

[Chorus]
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June

Can't make you happier now

Why don't we leave it at that?
Nothin' to say

Quando você tá bêbada, você me diz exatamente como se sente (Eu vou esperar por você, por você)
Quando eu tô carregado, mantenho a real (Eu vou esperar por você, vou esperar por você)

Fofoca, arrumando bagunça, isso não é o que estamos fazendo (O mundo estava acabando)
Viajar ao redor do mundo (Você choraria ou tentaria me pegar?)
Pelo telefone, derramando lágrimas (Me diga agora, eu quero que você seja claro, yeah)
Eu fico mais vulnerável quando tomo pílulas (Me diga agora, eu quero que você seja claro, yeah)
Quando você tá bêbada, você me diz exatamente como se sente (Eu vou esperar por você, por você)
Quando eu tô carregado, mantenho a real (Eu vou esperar por você, vou esperar por você)
Por favor, fala pra um verdadeiro exatamente o que é (Eu vou esperar, vou esperar, por você, por você)
Não diga isso porque você sabe que é isso que eu quero ouvir (Eu vou esperar por você, vou esperar por você)

Tengo una colombiana que mе escribe to' los día'
Y una mexicana quе ni yo sabía
Otra en San Antonio que me quiere todavía
Y las de PR que todita' son mía'
Una dominicana que es uva bombón
Uva, uva bombón
La de Barcelona que vino en avión
Y dice que mi bicho está cabrón
Yo dejo que jueguen con mi corazón
Quisiera mudarme con toda' pa' una mansión
El día que me case te envío la invitación
Muchacho, deja eso, ey

It was my wedding day (It was our wedding day)
We were getting ready
And there wasn't a cloud in the sky (No clouds allowed in the sky)
Bruno walks in with a mischievous grin (Thunder)
You telling this story or am I? (I'm sorry, mi vida, go on)
Bruno says, ""It looks like rain"" (Why did he tell us?)
In doing so, he floods my brain (Abuela, get the umbrellas)
Married in a hurricane (What a joyous day, but anyway)

We don't talk about Bruno, no, no, no (We don't talk about Bruno, no)

Grew to live in fear of Bruno stuttering or stumbling
I can always hear him sort of muttering and mumbling
I associate him with the sound of falling sand (Ch, ch, ch)
It's a heavy lift with a gift so humbling
Always left Abuela and the family fumbling
Grappling with prophecies they couldn't understand

When he calls your name, it all fades to black

Numb Little Bug,Em Beihold,"TranslationsDeutschNumb Little Bug Lyrics[Verse 1]
I don't feel a single thing
Have the pills done too much?
Haven't caught up with my friends in weeks
And now we're outta touch
I've been drivin' in L.A
And the world, it feels too big
Like a floating ball that's bound to break
Snap my psyche like a twig

[Pre-Chorus]
And I just wanna see
If you feel the same as me

[Chorus]
Do you ever get a little bit tired of life?
Like you're not really happy but you don't wanna die
Like you're hangin' by a thread but you gotta survive
'Cause you gotta survive
Like your body's in the room but you're not really there
Like you have empathy inside but you don't really care
Like you're fresh outta love but it's been in the air
Am I past repair?

[Post-Chorus]
A little bit tired of trying to care when I don't
A little bit tired of quick repairs to cope
A little bit tired of sinkin', there's water in my boat
I'm barely breathin', tryna stay afloat
So I got these quick repairs to cope
Guess I'm just broken and broke

Вновь проснулся бодреньким, так что знай: я в деле
Вновь проснулся бодреньким, шлюха, знай: я в деле
Вновь проснулся бодреньким, так что знай: я в деле
Вновь проснулся бодреньким, шлюха, знай: я в деле
Йеа, жизнь
Жизнь — единственное, в чём мы нуждаемся
Им же нужно избавиться от меня, но я не хочу уходить
Покойся с миром, Лил Кид

[Куплет 1: Дрейк]
Нахуй голубятню, я — сова, совершенно другой уровень
Мог бы заставить её набить шестёрку на мизинце
Слышал, ты фанатеешь по баскетболу, просто дай мне знать
Будешь сидеть на играх в первом ряду, а не в далеке
Всё впоряде, детка, по крайней мере, сейчас
Не хочу стрессовать из-за суки, ведь скромности у меня не отнять
Ещё я готовлю амбиции прямо на кухонной плите
Травка уже кипит, смотри на пенку, хорошо пойдёт
Шлюхи говорят я обходителен, поэтому не попаду в лапы RICO
Бро считает себя Джоном Уэйном, купил ему жёлтых камней
Мне нравятся их тусовочки, детка, нахуй силикон
Все люди сейчас фейковые, ты могла бы разгадать мой шифр
Всё покрою брюликами и розовым золотом
Говорю с вами на языке дредов, словно Джей Коул
Могу сказать её минет хорош перед тем, как это узнать
Сучка, не строй из себя модель, если не была на обложке Vogue
Нужно замутить вечеринку для самых близких
Они не пишут рэп, но могли бы выдать пару строк
Покойся с миром, Драма Кинг, мы с тобой умели показать стиль
Не нравится, как я говорю? Ниггер, скажи сам что-то
Нужно замутить вечеринку для самых близких
Подьезжаем и ты узнаешь нас, басс бомбит нехило
Не нравится, как я говорю? Скажи сам что-то
Убирайся с моего пути, ниггер

Я со своей пушкой, как Розей с лимонным перцем

Езжу по району, где мне сосут хуй (Факт)
Если хочешь вести здесь свои дела, то придётся брать ствол (21, 21)
А то бегаешь вокруг в страхе, подбери своё дерьмо (21)
Влюбился так, что голова идёт кругом, вот как я кручусь на районе (21)
Безумно люблю своего Boy'я, мой брат-близнец (21)
Если ниггеры продолжат диссить, то налетим опять на них (21)
Мы — причина, почему у оппов нет друзей (21)
Последний, кто хотел поиграть со мной, стал призраком
Я не зароллил его в Woods, ведь он заплесневел уже
Ты спрашиваешь, как её дела, я только что сказал прийти ей и заняться сексом
Выстрелил в него двадцать раз, блять, ниггер везунчик (Блять, ниггер везунчик)

Levitating,Dua Lipa,"TranslationsTürkçeEspañolEnglishDeutschFrançaisNederlandsLevitating Lyrics[Verse 1]
If you wanna run away with me, I know a galaxy
And I can take you for a ride
I had a premonition that we fell into a rhythm
Where the music don't stop for life
Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes
Shining just the way I like
If you're feeling like you need a little bit of company
You met me at the perfect time

[Pre-Chorus]
You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way, we're renegading
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating
You, moonlight, you're my starlight (You're the moonlight)
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating

[Verse 2]
I believe that you're for me, I feel it in our energy
I see us written in the stars
We can go wherever, so let's do it now or never
Baby, nothing's ever, ever too far
Glitter in the sky, glitter in our eyes
Shining just the way we are
I feel like we're forever every time we get together
But whatever, let's get lost on Mars

In A Minute,Lil Baby,"TranslationsEspañolPortuguêsIn A Minute Lyrics[Intro]
(Damn, Kai, you goin' crazy)

[Verse 1]
I be in the loop, she be in a group (Yeah)
Brodie want her friend, throw 'em alley-oop (Yeah)
Turned somethin' to nothin', bruh, I'm livin' proof
How can I lose when we the who's who's?
Still runnin' 'round with Mohawk, jet ready, pack the Goyard
People probably think I show off, I ain't even give it yet
Runnin' up a silly check, stayin' off the internet
Share the stage with Billie Eilish, turnt at any given time
Personal partners pillow talkin' 'cause I got rich without 'em
Only thing they should be sayin' is, ""Baby keep it solid""
We ain't even deep as we used to be, this shit slick, divided
Bruh ain't got no hustle or nothin', so he gon' stick to violence
I be known to run down, I'm dialed in, so I can't speak about it
She know I'm a gangster, she love me, I bring the freak up out her
Can't play with me, you know I come trim, I'm in a different league
I'm tired of showin' what I can get done, what you gon' do for me?
Forty-thousand miles up in the air, only time I get some Z's
Full-court press, foot on they neck, and I can't let 'em breathe
Blood, sweat, and tears come with this check, it ain't nowhere near easy
Had to fall back, you know how that go, we only speakin' briefly
Hope I'm not too much to handle, city nigga from Atlanta
I spent my last check on ammo, this is not a regular Lambo
Hundred thousand dollars kit, could've put down on another Lambo
Don't be in the mix, I built this shit forever havin' say so
This shit gon' get serious about my money, this ain't no fuckin' Play-Doh
Brodie down for double homicide, I try to tell him, ""Lay low""
C don't like to drive, but he spin good, I'm on the way to Clayco
AK-47s in the spots before they made the Draco
You might also like[Chorus]
I'm just tryna ball and live, hundred mill', I'm calling dibs
I'm the boss, pay all the bills, I'm the golden child for real
Go off in this bitch, I will, I been on my grind for years
And I'm out here grinding still, I need equity to sign the deal
I'm just tryna ball and live, hundred mill', I'm calling dibs
I'm the boss, pay all the bills, I'm the golden child for real
Go off in this bitch, I will, I been on my grind for years
And I'm out here grinding still, I need equity to sign the deal

[Verse 2]
Overbuying cars, I snatch the Brabus just for motivation
Shootout at the spot today, tomorrow, we in a new location
Free all of the guys, I hope y'all beat the case or get probation
Stash it at my mama house, four hundred bands in the ventilation
Now look how I'm living, I bought a house for the money to stay at
Right when niggas think that I got soft, I'ma pull up and spray at
Living like a don, might smoke a blunt in the back of the Maybach
Pull up like your mama with the switch, ""Why the fuck would you say that?”
You can do it first, I'ma do it worst, gotta double the pay back Never take it personal, show no mercy, bruh taught me that way back
Condo to get off, I was always taught, ""Don't tell hoes where you stay at""
Keep a stash house, you can't take nothing to the spot where you lay at
Never be a bother, if you off me, no problem, just say that
Never runnin' off, so if I owe you, I got you, I'll pay that
Give this shit my all, so when I'm old, I can chill and just lay back
Really from the bottom so the trenches is where I feel safe at
[Chorus]
I'm just tryna ball and live, hundred mill', I'm calling dibs
I'm the boss, pay all the bills, I'm the golden child for real
Go off in this bitch, I will, I been on my grind for years
And I'm out here grinding still, I need equity to sign the deal
I'm just tryna ball and live, hundred mill', I'm calling dibs
I'm the boss, pay all the bills, I'm the golden child for real
Go off in this bitch, I will, I been on my grind for years
And I'm out here grinding still, I need equity to sign the deal9Embed"

Cuida'o con ese mahón, que se va a romper (Ey)
Ese booty lo va a romper (Ey)
Yo no sé si yo te vuelvo a ver
Si mañana me vo'a perder
Tú ere' una player, me hiciste un crossover
Esta ve' metiste, me diste game over, eh-eh (Huh)
Porque no puedo olvidar
El perreo aquel que se fue viral
Dime si mañana te va' a quedar
Después de la alarma te lo voy a dar, ey

She Had Me At Heads Carolina,Cole Swindell,"She Had Me At Heads Carolina Lyrics[Intro]
(Heads Carolina, tails California)

[Verse 1]
I was out with the boys, catchin' up in a neon light
Didn't know 'til we walked in it was karaoke night
She was in a circle of girls, chasin' a shot with a lime
She was laughin', they were darin' her to get on the mic
One of 'em walked up and turned in her name
Next thing I knew, man, she was up on the stage, singin'

[Chorus]
""Heads Carolina, tails California""
Maybe she'd fall for a boy from South Georgia
She's got the bar in the palm of her hand
And she's a '90s country fan like I am
Hey, I got a Chevy, she can flip a quarter
I'd drive hеr anywhere from herе to California
When this song is over, I gotta find her
'Cause she had me at ""Heads Carolina""

[Verse 2]
Yeah, she knew every word by heart, didn't need no screen, no
I was raisin' my glass up for her, I saw her smilin' at me, yeah
She had me down in the front by the end of verse two
Like there wasn't no one else in the room, we were singin'

I still see that girl every time I hear that song

Had your ass sittin' first class with your burnt ass out in Abu Dhabi

Buy Dirt,Jordan Davis Featuring Luke Bryan,"Buy Dirt Lyrics[Verse 1: Jordan Davis]
Few days before he turned 80
He was sitting out back in a rocker
He said ""What you been up to lately?""
I told him chasing a dollar
And in between sips of coffee
He poured this wisdom out
Said ""If you want my two cents on making a dollar count

[Chorus: Jordan Davis]
Buy dirt
Find the one you can't live without
Get a ring, let your knee hit the ground
Do what you love but call it work
And throw a little money in the plate at church
Send your prayers up and your roots down deep
Add a few limbs to your family tree
And watch their pencils marks, and the grass in the yard
All grow up
'Cause the truth about it is it all goes by real quick
You can't buy happiness
But you can buy dirt""

[Verse 2: Luke Bryan]
Before you get caught on that ladder
Let me tell you what it's all about
Find you a few things that matter
That you can put a fence around
