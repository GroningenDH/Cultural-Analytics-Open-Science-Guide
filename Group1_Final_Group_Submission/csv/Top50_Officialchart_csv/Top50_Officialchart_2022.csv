Come on, Harry, we wanna say goodnight to you

[Verse 1]
Holdin' me back
Gravity's holdin' me back
I want you to hold out the palm of your hand
Why don't we leave it at that?
Nothin' to say
When everything gets in the way
Seems you cannot be replaced
And I'm the one who will stay, oh-oh-oh

In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was, as it was
You know it's not the same

[Verse 2]
Answer the phone
""Harry, you're no good alone
Why are you sitting at home on the floor?
What kind of pills are you on?""
Ringin' the bell
And nobody's coming to help
Your daddy lives by himself
He just wants to know that you're well, oh-oh-oh

In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
In this world, it's just us

Every time you come around, you know I can't say no
Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes

It's a human sign
When things go wrong
When the scent of her lingers
And temptation's strong

[Pre-Chorus: Elton John]
Cold, cold heart
Hardened by you
Some things lookin' better, baby
Just passin' through (No, no, no, no, no)
[Chorus: Dua Lipa]
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no, no, no
And this is what I should have said
Well, I thought it, but I kept it in

[Pre-Chorus: Elton John]
Cold, cold heart
Hardened by you (Oh)
Some things lookin' better, baby
Just passin' through (No, no, no, no, no)

[Chorus: Dua Lipa]
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no, no, no (No, no, no, no, no)
And this is what I should have ever said
Well, I thought it, but I kept it in (No, no, no, no, no)

Uoy evol I, sdrow rehto ni
Uoy evol I, sdrow rehto ni

[Chorus]
It's hard to hate on the truth I'm livin' in
'Nough man hate with the lies instead
Countin' cash with the phone to my ear
I feel like Meek on a private jet
Life or death, five-five
Eyes, thighs, potential wifey
Industry, respected highly
In the street, protected
[Verse 1]
I do know my man, but I don't trust him
Trust that, Ps in the trap, disgustin'
Stick with the stick, PVA, PDA, kiss that in public
South London where I made my
South London's where I made my first hundred
Elastic bands, plastic bags, two and a blue like cheese and onion
In Jamaica, quick vacation, travellin' my pastimе
'Nough pollution in the ends, I flew back yard 'cah I wanna see starlight
Eritrеan, skin tone cinnamon, I think I found my princess
My empress, still gonna impress
I know 'dem man talk on the kid, but

[Chorus]
It's hard to hate on the truth I'm livin' in
'Nough man hate with the lies instead
Countin' cash with the phone to my ear
I feel like Meek on the private jet
Life or death, five-five
Eyes, thighs, potential wifey
Industry, respected highly
In the street, protected

[Verse 2]
Any girl that I'm datin' knows, bags that I buy come filled with fifties
She a ten out of ten on a bad day, public affection, I tell her, ""Come kiss me""
I like mine obsessed, clingy
If she don't miss me, miss me
If she don't miss me, history
If she don't miss me, it's a mystery
G17 in the party, tipsy
Don't drink, that's risky
Focus, shells gonna land like Disney
And put him down under, Sydney
That's bae, I'll donate both my kidneys
True love, what the kid needs
And a girl from the Westest Indies
I know them man talk on the kid but

It's hard to hate on the truth I'm livin' in

Eyes, thighs, potential wifey
Industry, respected highly
In the street, protected

[Verse 3]
In this world that I'm in
How you wanna take pics with the belts in the ring
But don't help in the gym?
'Nough girls datin' their biggest haters
How her boyfriend don't want her to win? Like, rah
And why my girlfriend never wanna see me have a good time out if she ain't there?
Yeah, yeah (Fly— Fly me to the moon)
Fly me to the moon, let me get some space
Seein' them stars on her private story
I dust that chick, she got no grace
(Let me see what spring is like on Jupiter)
See her ex man, she got no taste, hip dip, she got no waist
Body snatched, servin' face (In other words, hold my hand)
Haha, hold my hand, personal trainer
Frequent flyer, bad, she toned and tan
Free my gang, 013's and 020's (Darlin' miss me)
Oh God knows, I miss my bros
I just got a call from jail on the phone and that might
[Outro: Ree Paramagita]
Fill my heart with song
And let me sing forevermore
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore
In other words, please be true
In other words, I love you
In other words, I love you31Embed"

And there's no one in here living
Gonna make it out alive

Over the hills and undercover

Fuck you and your mom and your sister and your job
And your broke-ass car and that shit you call art
Fuck you and your friends that I'll never see again
Everybody but your dog, you can all fuck off

[Verse 1]
I swear I meant to mean the best when it ended
Even tried to bite my tongue when you start shit
Now you're textin' all my friends asking questions
They never even liked you in the first place
Dated a girl that I hate for the attention
She only made it two days, what a connection
It's like you'd do anythin' for my affection
You're goin' all about it in the worst ways
[Pre-Chorus]
I was into you, but I'm ovеr it now
And I was tryna be nice
But nothing's getting through, so lеt me spell it out

[Chorus]
A-B-C-D-E, F you
And your mom and your sister and your job
And your broke-ass car and that shit you call art
Fuck you and your friends that I'll never see again
Everybody but your dog, you can all fuck off

[Post-Chorus]
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
A-B-C-D-E, F you
[Verse 2]
You said you just needed space and so I gave it
When I had nothin' to say, you couldn't take it
Told everyone I'm a bitch, so I became it
Always had to put yourself above me

[Pre-Chorus]
I was into you, but I'm over it now
And I was tryna be nice
But nothing's getting through, so let me spell it out

But now I give up

I tell my lil' nigga, ""Go flex in my Rollie, no money to waste"" (Waste)

[Chorus: Young Adz]
The year has just started and right now, I'm lookin' for cribs overseas
I'm givin' my lady some drivin' lessons in a hundred-grand Jeep
When you see me in public, no photos, man, I need some privacy please
Good girl, she just sat on my face now she's sayin' her legs have gone weak
Bad, bad, see the jakes outside, now I'm flushin' the work down the toilet
Mad, mad, Richard Mille, a crib by the port and it's imported
Sad, sad, if you knew the truth 'bout that nigga then it would get awkward
And I know that nigga get money now, I am the nigga that taught him16Embed"

(Happy Christmas)
Ah, ah-ah
Ooh-woah
Oh-oh

[Chorus]
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away (You gave it away)
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (Special)
[Verse 1]
Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye
Tell me, baby, do you recognise me?
Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me
""Happy Christmas,"" I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying, ""I love you,"" I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again

[Chorus]
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away (You gave it away)
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (Special)
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (Special, oh)
Oh, oh, baby

[Verse 2]
A crowded room, friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God, I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
A face of a lover with a fire in his heart
A man undercover, but you tore me apart
Ooh-ooh
Now I've found a real love, you'll never fool me again

But the very next day, you gave it away (You gave me away)
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (Special)

[Verse 3]
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart (I gave you my heart)
A man undercover, but you tore him apart
Maybe next year
I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone special

[Bridge]
Special
Someone
Someone
I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone special
Who give me something in return

Hold my heart and watch it burn
I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone special
I thought you were here to stay
How could you love me for a day?
I thought you were someone special
I gave you my heart
I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone

I'm the strong one, I'm not nervous
I'm as tough as the crust of the Earth is
I move mountains, I move churches
And I glow, 'cause I know what my worth is
I don't ask how hard the work is
Got a rough, indestructible surface
Diamonds and platinum, I find 'em, I flatten 'em
I take what I'm handed, I break what's demanded, but

[Verse 1]
Under the surface
I feel berserk as a tightrope walker in a three-ring circus
Under the surface
Was Hercules ever like, ""Yo, I don't wanna fight Cerberus?""
Under the surface
I'm pretty surе I'm worthless if I can't be of servicе
[Pre-Chorus]
A flaw or a crack, the straw in the stack
That breaks the camel's back
What breaks the camel's back, it's

[Chorus]
Pressure like a drip, drip, drip that'll never stop, whoa
Pressure that'll tip, tip, tip 'til you just go pop, whoa-oh-oh
Give it to your sister, your sister's older
Give her all the heavy things we can't shoulder
Who am I if I can't run with the ball?
If I fall to
Pressure like a grip, grip, grip, and it won't let go, whoa
Pressure like a tick, tick, tick 'til it's ready to blow, whoa-oh-oh
Give it to your sister, your sister's stronger
See if she can hang on a little longer
Who am I if I can't carry it all?
If I falter

[Verse 2]
Under the surface
I hide my nerves and it worsens, I worry somethin' is gonna hurt us
Under the surface
The ship doesn't swerve, has it heard how big the iceberg is?
Under the surface
I think about my purpose, can I somehow preserve this?
Line up the dominoes, a light wind blows
You try to stop it tumbling, but on and on it goes
You might also like[Bridge]
But wait, if I could shake the crushing weight of expectations
Would that free some room up for joy
Or relaxation, or simple pleasure?
Instead, we measure this growing pressure
Keeps growing, keep going, 'cause all we know is

Pressure like a drip, drip, drip that'll never stop, whoa
Pressure that'll tip, tip, tip 'til you just go pop, whoa-oh-oh
Give it to your sister, it doesn't hurt and
See if she can handle every family burden
Watch as she buckles and bends but never breaks
No mistakes, just
Pressure like a grip, grip, grip, and it won't let go, whoa
Pressure like a tick, tick, tick 'til it's ready to blow, whoa-oh-oh
Give it to your sister and never wonder
If the same pressure would've pulled you under

Five man deep gonna run man down

[Verse 1]
You want the girl with the small waist
And the perfect smile
Someone who's out every weekday
In her dad's new car
You tell me I shouldn't stress out
Say, ""It's not that hard""
But I just got a feeling
This will leave an ugly scar
[Pre-Chorus]
If you say, ""She's nothing to worry about""
Then why'd you close your eyes when you said it out loud?

[Chorus]
Stupid boy making me so sad
Didn't think you could change this fast
She's got everything that I don't have
How could I ever compete with that?
I know you'll go and change your mind
One day wake up and be bored with mine
She's got everything that I don't havе
And she's all I wanna be, all I wanna be so bad, so bad
Shе's got everything that I don't have, hm-mm

[Verse 2]
You want someone you can show off
Whenever you go out
She'll wear a tight mini black dress
With all her friends around
And then you'll probably spend the night at
Her nice big house
And by then I'll just be someone
You've forgotten about, oh

[Verso 1: Future]
Você reza pelos meus demônios, garota, eu entendo você
Toda vez que eu bebo codeína, fico vulnerável
Eu conheço os sons da tempestade quando ela chеga
Ela entende quе eu não posso levar ela pra todos os lugares que eu vou
Eu estive no campo tipo os filhos do milho
[Refrão: Future & Tems]
Eu posso ouvir suas lágrimas quando elas caem pelo telefone
Fica brava consigo mesma porque não consegue me deixar em paz
Fofoca, arrumando bagunça, isso não é o que estamos fazendo (O mundo estava acabando)
Viajar ao redor do mundo (Você choraria ou tentaria me pegar?)
Pelo telefone, derramando lágrimas (Me diga agora, eu quero que você seja claro, yeah)
Eu fico mais vulnerável quando tomo pílulas (Me diga agora, eu quero que você seja claro, yeah)
Quando você tá bêbada, você me diz exatamente como se sente (Eu vou esperar por você, por você)
Quando eu tô carregado, mantenho a real (Eu vou esperar por você, vou esperar por você)
Por favor, fala pra um verdadeiro exatamente o que é (Eu vou esperar, vou esperar, por você, por você)
Não diga isso porque você sabe que é isso que eu quero ouvir (Eu vou esperar por você, vou esperar por você)

[Verso 2: Drake & Tems]
Yeah, eu estive viajando ao redor do mundo
Eu sento na minha varanda e me pergunto como você tá se sentindo
Eu tenho uma carreira que tira meu tempo das mulheres
Eu não posso te convencer de que eu te amo pra sempre (Vou esperar por você, por você)
Eu vou estar te ligando, os sentimentos estão fluindo como um rio
Você vai estar mandando mensagens de volta pra Kiki no rio (Eu vou esperar por você)
A mensagem foi entregue (Eu vou esperar por você), mas eu sei que você não leu
Por que você nos apresenta se você sabia que tava com ele? (Eu vou esperar por você, por você, por você)
Me fez apertar a mão dele quando vocês estavam transando à um minuto (Eu vou esperar por você, por você)
Me fez caminhar na prancha, porque você sabe que eu sou um nadador (Eu vou esperar por você)
Eu deveria ser seu cachorro, mas você me colocou num canil
Garota, coloque uma focinheira nisso, em todos aqueles latidos durante o jantar
Eu tava fechado com você quando você ganhou o Presidencial pequeno
Você melhorou quando me conheceu e isso não é coincidência
Tentei trazer o melhor de você, acho que eu não sou tão influente
Acho que eu não sou o cara para você

I had a bad week
Spent the evening pretending it wasn't that deep
You could see in my eyes that it was taking over
I guess I was just blind and caught up in the moment
You know you take all of my stress right down
Help me get it off my chest and out
Into the ether with the rest of this mess that just keeps us depressed
We forget that we're here right now

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause we're livin' life at a different pace
Stuck in a constant race
Keep the pressure on, you're bound to break
Something's gotta change
We should just be cancelling all our plans and not give a damn
If we're missin' out on what the people think is right
Seein' through a picture behind the screen and forget to be
Lose the conversation for the message that you'll never read
I think maybe you and me
Oh, we should head out to the place where the music plays
And then
[Chorus]
We'll go all night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
All my troubles turn to nothin' when I'm in your eyes, electrified
We'll keep turnin' up and go all night
Oh, we had dips and falls in our time
But we know what it feels to be low then up, alone, then loved
And all we need is us to go all

[Post-Chorus]
Night, night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us

[Verse 2]
What do you reckon, is it just me?
Words are weapons and occasionally they cut deep
Crisis of confidence, it tends to come when I feel the dark and I open my heart
If you don't see it, you should trust me
I feel like I got nothin' left right now
Except this beauty in her dress right now
She got me feelin' like the best, and the rest are just less than she needs
So we press play and step to the beat
