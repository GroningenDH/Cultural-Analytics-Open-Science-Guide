(One, two, three, four)
Ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
Every time you come around, you know I can't say no
Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes
And tonight had something wonderful

[Chorus]
My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's truе, it's true
My bad habits lead to you
[Post-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lеad to you

[Verse 2]
Every pure intention ends when the good times start
Fallin' over everything to reach the first time's spark
It started under neon lights and then it all got dark
I only know how to go too far

[Chorus]
My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's true, it's true

'Cause you were so excited for me
To finally drive up to your house
But today, I drove through the suburbs
Crying 'cause you weren't around

And I know we weren't perfect, but I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

[Verse 3]
And all my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you, but
I kinda feel sorry for them
'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do

And pictured I was driving home to you

There ain't no gold in this river
That I've been washin' my hands in forever
I know there is hope in these waters
But I can't bring myself to swim
When I am drowning in this silence
Baby, let me in
[Chorus]
Go easy on me, baby
I was still a child
Didn't get the chance to
Feel the world around me
I had no time to choose what I chose to do
So go easy on me
[Verse 2]
There ain't no room for things to change
When we are both so deeply stuck in our ways
You can't deny how hard I've tried
I changed who I was to put you both first
But now I give up
[Chorus]
Go easy on mе, baby
I was still a child
Didn't get the chance to
Feel thе world around me
Had no time to choose what I chose to do
So go easy on me

[Bridge]
I had good intentions
And the highest hopes
But I know right now
It probably doesn't even show
[Chorus]
Go easy on me, baby
I was still a child
I didn't get the chance to
Feel the world around me
I had no time to choose what I chose to do
So go easy on meYou might also like155Embed"

Hello, it's me, your ex
I called to say not sorry, but I wish you the best
And I don't hold no grudges, promise this ain't a test
We okay, we okay

[Pre-Chorus: Leigh-Anne]
Sometimes it works out, but sometimes it don't
Maybe we'll fix this or maybe we won't
Sometimes a heart can sink like a stone
Until you find home
[Chorus: Perrie, All]
This ain't a heartbreak anthem
I don't care what happened
But I ain't got no time to dwell on it
Don't wanna throw a tantrum
You did what you had to
No, I ain't got no time to dwell on it
And I don't wanna feel, I don't wanna feel hollow
Chasin' you and me, chasin' all of these shadows
This ain't a heartbreak anthem
I don't care what happened
But I ain't got no time to dwell on it

[Post-Chorus: All, Perrie]
This ain't a heartbreak anthem (Ooh-ooh)
This ain't a heartbreak, this ain't a heartbreak
This ain't a heartbreak anthem
No heartbreak anthem, no heartbreak anthem
(Ain't a heartbreak)

[Verse 2: Jade]
Hello, it's me, your ex (Again)
I didn't wanna call, but there's this pain in my chest
And thanks to you I'm wearing out this bulletproof vest
But I'll be okay (Okay), I'm okay (I'm okay)
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Leigh-Anne, Perrie]
Sometimes it works out, but sometimes it don't (Sometimes it don't)
Maybe we'll fix this or maybe we won't
Sometimes a heart can sink like a stone
Until you find home

[Chorus: Perrie, Leigh-Anne, Jade, All]
This ain't a heartbreak anthem (No)
I don't care what happened
But I ain't got no time to dwell on it (Time to dwell on it, oh)
Don't wanna throw a tantrum (Ah)
You did what you had to
No, I ain't got no time to dwell on it
And I don't wanna feel (I don't wanna feel), I don't wanna feel hollow (Hollow)
Chasin' you and me, chasin' all of these shadows
This ain't a heartbreak anthem
I don't care what happened
But I ain't got no time to dwell on it (To dwell on it)

[Post-Chorus: All, Perrie, Jade]
This ain't a heartbreak anthem (Ooh-ooh)
This ain't a heartbreak, this ain't a heartbreak
This ain't a heartbreak anthem
No heartbreak anthem, no heartbreak anthem
(Ain't a heartbreak; No, ooh)
[Outro: All, Jade, Leigh-Anne]
And I don't wanna feel, I don't wanna feel hollow
Chasin' you and me, chasin' all of these shadows (Chasin' all of these shadows)

I'd never have given you a second look
But I like the way you don't give a damn
You seem like someone I could pick a fight with
And dance all night with
Maybe you'll like me the way I am

[Pre-Chorus: Ella Henderson]
And even though you got bad tattoos and smell like booze
I'm into you
Even though you got an attitude
Baby, I'm in love
[Chorus: Ella Henderson, Tom Grennan, Both]
I've said a little too much
I'm a little bit drunk
Feels like I know you so well
You could be everything that I've been missing
I'm coming out of my shell
And I never do that

Underneath the mistletoe

To the North Pole for Saint Nick (Ah)

Holding on to me so tight (Ooh)

Oh baby, all I want for Christmas is you
You, baby

So brightly everywhere (So brightly, baby)
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air (Oh, oh yeah)
And everyone is singing (Oh yeah)
I hear those sleigh bells ringing (Oh)
Santa, won't you bring me the one I really need? (Yeah, oh, oh)
Won't you please bring my baby to me?

Guess I'm just a moment livin' in your past
But I never thought you'd forget me so fast

Jordan 4s or Jordan 1s, Rolexes, got more than one
My AP cost thirty-one, millimeters: forty-one
Stick him up with a stick-stick, he drew the shorter one
You can't short me one, in the club with the shortest one
Lighty, the shortest one, on my mind, Jorja one
Crocodile bag, I bought her one, vegan ting, I slaughter one
Freaks, I got more than one, fuck, daddy and daughter one (One)
Tory puttin' in labour, this that Jeremy Corbyn one

[Verse 1: Dave]
Awkward one, race me there, wait, hare, tortoise one
I need a ting, thirty plus, Blackberry and Walkman 1's
Look, I left my phone and my babies, silent mode
My guys on ridin' mode, zombies, survival mode
He's got a new vest? Man, pop that shield, no microphone
I'll ride for bro, he's next to I like typin' O
The score: 5 and 0, 6-to-1
For the kicks I love, twelve-fifty-four like 6-to-1
Babe, can't look at my mentions, that's Area 51

[Verse 2: Stormzy]
Overrated one, most hated one
Slid 'round after his birthday, gave him a happy belated one
Burned that bridge, cremated one, boom-boom, bailiff one
Got away with murder, this that Viola Davis one
They stop and stare, watch rare, clear, stainless one
Debate this one, hatin'-niggas gonna hate this one, ah
I live life on the high, might fly to Dubai with the guys 'cause the weather's been shit
I can wear a different kettle every day of the month from a different—
Rollies, got twenty-one, I been lit since twenty-one
Girl, I need that gently one, that Savage and Fenty one, hmm
Dave's got the new Aston Martin plug, could you send me one?
He said ""No need to be rentin' one""
Big flexes, inventin' one, cold, cold
My bros don't chat, we just wear all-black on a blend-in one
Man are talkin' war, don't know 'bout war 'til you end in one
The machine got sweets, on a vending one
Needed a hit, could have penned him one, 'cah you're pendin' one
Aight, she wanna go to the cinema, so we just walk downstairs (Walk downstairs)
The mortgage cleared, we've overtaken all our peers (All our peers)
After all these years, disrespect is all I hear

Baby, we tried to fight it
We all been there some days
Thought I needed something else
And acted like I was okay
We just had to work it out
And baby, I needed space
Ain't nobody 'round here on your level
You're so far away
You're pouring your heart out
I'm acting like I knew
You held me so down
So down I never grew, oh
I tried to find out
When none of them came through
And now I'm stuck in the middle
And baby had to pull me out, oh

You the type I wanna marry (Yeah) and keep you merry
I'll put the ring on when you ready

No Final Fantasy, can we end these games though?
You give me energy, make me feel lightweight (Woo)
Like the birds of a feather, baby (Woo)
We real life made for each other (Woo)

When other bitches tryna get with my dude and
When other chickens tryna get in my coop

There ain't no man like you
