I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to hear,  somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

[Chorus]
Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
[Verse 2]
I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to hear
Somebody to have, just to know how it feels
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape

[Chorus]
Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

[Bridge]
And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound till I come back around

[Chorus]
For now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
But now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

I see stars in your eyes when we're halfway there (All night)
ستاره هارو توی چشمات میبینم وقتی نصف راهو تا اونجا میریم (تموم شب)
I'm not fazed by all them lights and flashin' cameras
من با همه ی چراغاشون و فلش دوربیناشون به هم ریخته نمیشم (حواسم از تو پرت نمیشه)
'Cause with my arms around you, there's no need to care
چونکه با دستایی که تورو بغل کردن، دیگه نیازی به اهمیت دادن به اونا ندارم

We don't fit in well, we are just ourselves
خوب با همدیگه کنار نمیایم چونکه ما فقط خودمونیم
I could use some help gettin' out of this conversation, yeah
میتونستم یه ذره کمگ بگیرم که از این بحث و جدل بکشیم بیرون، آره
You look stunning, dear, so don't ask that question here
خیلی خوشگل شدی، عزیزم، پس دیگه اون سوالو اینجا نپرس
This is my only fear: that we become
تنها ترسم اینه که: بشیم مثل ....

So take me back to London (Yo)

I do deals, but I never get twanged (Twanged)
Moves that ain't ever been planned (Planned)
No goons that were never in gangs (Gangs)
Where I'm from, chat shit get banged (What?)
Where I'm from, chat shit, let a 12 gauge rip
Yeah, it's sick how it fits in my hand (Hand)
I don't mix with the glitz and the glam (Glam)
All these stupid pricks on the 'Gram
I don't do online beef, or neeky grime beef
I'm way too G'd up to beef with grime neek
I bought an AP to help me time keep
My shooter ride deep, he moves when I speak
My shooter ride (Ride), he shoot a guy (Guy)
Leave you wet like you scuba dived
We were younger then and now we're unified
South London boys, get you crucified, I'm gone
[Verse 2: Ed Sheeran & Stormzy]
It's that time
Big Mike and Teddy are on grime
I wanna try new things, they just want me to sing
Because nobody thinks I write rhymes
And now I'm back in the bits with my guy
Give me a packet of crisps with my pint
I hit my friends up, go straight to the pub
'Cause I haven't been home in time, yes, I
But that's my fault (Oh)
Grossed half a billi' on the Divide Tour (Oh)
Yes, I ain't kidding, what would I lie for? (Oh)
But now I'm back on the track with Big Michael (Woah)
He said, ""Teddy, never get off your high horse
And never let 'em take your crown""
I've been away for a while, traveled a million miles
But I'm heading back to London town right now

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Stormzy]
Jet plane headed up to the sky (To the sky)
Spread wings in the clouds, getting high (Woop, woop)
We ain't hit a rave in a while (In a while)

Sweat brow drippin' down, when in Rome (When in Rome)

I drink supermalts and Vibranium
I got an RM11 titanium
And I rock a 5970 daily, but
I want soul, I want flows
Don't need tags ripping off my clothes
Don't need pricks blowin' up my phone
And Ted said, ""That's just the way things go""
It's just the way things go, amazin' flows
Grime or rap, man, I gave 'em both
Took this sound that was made in Bow
Went global, man, now the case is closed
2015 in a Badingham pub
I told Stormz two years, he'll be wrappin' it up
And you'll go through tears with the people you love
But when you get to the top, man, it's never enough
'Cause you can win BRITs (It don't stop)
And you can do Glasto (Headline slot)
But when you're miles away and you're feelin' alone
Gotta remember that there ain't no place like home

So I get lost in modern music, watchin' movies, talkin' to the walls in my room
Walkin' through the halls in my head, just tryna make sure it all makes sense

But often I be OT tourin'
Gyal don't worry I'll be yard in the mornin'
Used to move like there's nothin' to lose
Mixed the Off-White with the Hues
Rollin' with like 10 of the goons
[Verse 1: Kruddz]
Money callin', money talkin'
Trap phone goin' ring ring
Trap phone buy me bling-bling, yeah
Where was you way back then?
I was doing stick up with my bad friends
Police had us twist up pon the landin'
Every other time mix up in violence

[Verse 2: PapiiAbz]
Not just because of the bustdown
But I'm on the grind 'till I'm up now
Hustle in the blood, I'm a hustler
Tough striker call me Costa
And my line ringin' from qway
Trap line ringin' all day
And my line ringin' from qway
Trap line singin' all day

[Chorus: OGD]
Want to make a mil', 9-5 weren't an option
In the field you kinda run outta options
She always complain like she nah see me often
But often I be OT tourin'
Gyal don't worry I'll be yard in the mornin'
Used to move like there's nothin' to lose
Mixed the Off-White with the Hues
Rollin' with like 10 of the goons

Ghetto and stylish
LV drop, man I rock it with sliders
Shopping abroad first day I'm off-license
Came fresh home first thing I done, diamonds
All about timin', wrist so blindin'
'Cause she's all boo'd up, man she got haters
We don't fly Europe, we just go Vegas
Man try draws her, she don't do strangers
Fuck about status, uh
'Bout Corsa, put her in a Porsche
Eyebrow sharpish, lookin' like my borer
Come a long way from chillin' on a corner
Fat ass, bloody hell that's torture
I ain't getting poorer
Always complain that she can't see me often
I just keep it real, I can't run out of option
I can see you're stressed out and you keep callin'
Gyal don't worry I'll be yard in the mornin'

[Chorus: OGD]
Want to make a mil', 9-5 weren't an option
In the field you kinda run outta options

[Verse 4: Mojo]
Amazing, all of this money I'm making
Nights on the back roads, didn't phase me
Did it for the culture where they raised me
About to make a move
Might have to sell food
Do what you gotta do
And tell the judge, ""Free the goons""

[Verse 5: OGD]
Put that loud pack in my loud pack
And I'm totin' it quick plus all of the gang
Baby girl you look familiar
Convo start and mi wan' fi get familiar, sho
Girl,​ I'm a trendy yute
Lemme put you in them new Fendi shoes
Guys only hate when they wanna be you
Guys only hate when they wanna be you
I can never be you, nah nah

[Chorus: OGD]
Want to make a mil', 9-5 weren't an option
In the field you're gonna run outta options
She always complain like she nah see me often
But often I be OT tourin'
Gyal don't worry I'll be yard in the mornin'
Used to move like there's nothin' to lose
Mixed the Off-White with the Hues
Rollin' with like 10 of the goons

[Outro: DopeBoy]
Makin' money
She said, ""Nigga, you don't make no time for me""
Because mi trap-trap 'til the early mornin'
And now they pray on the downfall of me
You can't take my shine

There's no stoppin' this grind

Pull up and bark it, let it rain
Excellent head on your neck with brain

Racked-Racked up cakey, not Paigey
You're crazy, don't get blazed (Bullet)
Pump man out with that pumper (Bow)
Cali weed, I love ganja (Love)
Oh my gosh, look at her bumper, bumper
'Course I left with her number ('Course)
Brown and leng, give her this thunder
That's your girl, she left with my jumper (Huh)
Hundred stabs, she screaming for mother

[Verse 2: Tion Wayne]
I ain't into verbal or beefin'
Or the internet talk or tweetin'
They love Snapchat, Camden's speakin'
Me, I was knockin' at man on G-wing
Visit days in the field was a scary place
Nigga, T-Wayne was the reason
Even all now I don't like conversation
Back then, chains it was confiscation'
Go and check my light-skinned in Enfield
Check my dark-skinned ting in Tottenham
Pull up in a Range or the Merc, got options
Uptown, I don't see the opps often
But catch me in Central London
'Cah I love the finer things
Man, I love dem diamond things
I ain't going inside 'til my Niners in
We ain't going inside 'til line is in

Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?

Come here
Say it, spit it out, what is it exactly
You're payin'? Is the amount cleanin' you out? Am I satisfactory?
Today, I'm thinkin' about the things that are deadly
The way I'm drinkin' you down
Like I wanna drown, like I wanna end me
[Refrain: Billie Eilish]
Step on the glass, staple your tongue (Ahh)
Bury a friend, try to wake up (Ah-ahh)
Cannibal class, killing the son (Ahh)
Bury a friend, I wanna end me

[Verse 2: Billie Eilish & Mehki Raine]
Listen
Keep you in the dark, what had you expected?
Me to make you my art and make you a star
And get you connected?
I'll meet you in the park, I'll be calm and collected
But we knew right from the start that you'd fall apart
'Cause I'm too expensive
It's probably somethin' that shouldn't be said out loud
Honestly, I thought that I would be dead by now (Wow)
Calling security, keepin' my head held down
Bury the hatchet or bury a friend right now

I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

When the morning comes
When we see what we've become
In the cold light of day, we're a flame in the wind
Not the fire that we've begun
Every argument, every word we can't take back
'Cause with all that has happened
I think that we both know the way that this story ends

Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

But we ran our course, we pretended we're okay
Now if we jump together, at least we can swim
Far away from the wreck we made

When I was young, I fell in love
We used to hold hands, man, that was enough (Yeah)
Then we grew up, started to touch
Used to kiss underneath the light on the back of the bus (Yeah)
I know your daddy didn't like me much
And he didn't believe me when I said you were the one
Oh, every day, she found a way out of the window to sneak out late
[Pre-Chorus: Khalid]
She used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't set
And every day, you know that we'd ride
Through the backstreets in a blue Corvette
Baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight
We can go anywhere we want
Drive down to the coast, jump in the sea
Just take my hand and come with me, yeah

[Chorus: Khalid]
We can do anything if we put our minds to it
Take your old life, then you put a line through it
My love is yours if you're willing to take it
Give me your heart 'cause I ain't gonna break it
So come away, starting today
Start a new life together in a different place
We know that love is how all these ideas came to be
So baby, run away with me

[Verse 2: Halsey]
Seventeen, and we got a dream to have a family
A house, and everything in between
And then, oh, suddenly, we turned twenty-three
And now we got pressure for taking our life more seriously

’Cause my body is callin' for you, callin’ for you

To do the things that I do, mhm

Energy's takin’ control
I'm speedin' up
My heartbeat's dancin' alone

It's sad we're not together, but I wish happiness for you
I know we said forever, love don't always make it through

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes, even the good things get lost along the way
We opened up the same book, we found a different page
'Cause honestly, your loyalties, insecurities
And priorities ain't the same
The harmony, it's the only thing I can save

I wish you well, I wish you well (I wish you well, I wish you well)
I wish you well, I wish you well (I wish you well, I wish you well)
'Cause honestly your loyalties, insecurities
And priorities ain't the same
The harmony, it's the only thing I can save
I wish you well, I wish you well
(I wish you, I wish you, I wish you)
I wish you well
I wish you well

[Verse 2]
I hope that you remember, that I was always good to you
And even though you hurt me, ah, I just had to see it through

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes, even the good things get lost along the way
I had to let you go, but I wanted you to stay
'Cause honestly, your loyalties, insecurities
And priorities ain't the same
The harmony, it's the only thing I can save
