Oh, darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight

[Verse 2]
Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own

[Pre-Chorus]
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

[Chorus 2]
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful

When I was young, I fell in love
We used to hold hands, man, that was enough (Yeah)
Then we grew up, started to touch
Used to kiss underneath the light on the back of the bus (Yeah)
I know your daddy didn't like me much
And he didn't believe me when I said you were the one
Oh, every day, she found a way out of the window to sneak out late

She used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't set
And every day, you know that we'd ride
Through the backstreets in a blue Corvette
Baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight
We can go anywhere we want
Drive down to the coast, jump in the sea
Just take my hand and come with me, yeah

[Chorus: Khalid]
We can do anything if we put our minds to it
Take your old life, then you put a line through it
My love is yours if you're willing to take it
Give me your heart 'cause I ain't gonna break it
So come away, starting today
Start a new life together in a different place
We know that love is how all these ideas came to be
So baby, run away with me

[Verse 2: Halsey]
Seventeen, and we got a dream to have a family
A house, and everything in between
And then, oh, suddenly, we turned twenty-three
And now we got pressure for taking our life more seriously
We got our dead-end jobs and got bills to pay
Our old friends are now our enemies

Back to the day when I was falling in love

Used to keep my picture posted by your bedside
Now it's in your dresser with the socks you don't like

With my brothers like it's Jonas, Jonas
Drinkin' Henny and I'm tryna forget

The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead
[Chorus]
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I, oh, I
I'm in love with your body
Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I, oh, I

Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

[Verse 2]
One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

You know I want you
It's not a secret I try to hide
I know you want me
So don't keep sayin' our hands are tied
You claim it's not in the cards
And fate is pulling you miles away and out of reach from me
But you're here in my heart
So who can stop me if I decide that you're my destiny?

[Chorus: Zac Efron]
What if we rewrite the stars?
Say you were made to be mine?
Nothing could keep us apart
You'd be the one I was meant to find
It's up to you and it's up to me
No one can say what we get to be
So why don't we rewrite the stars?
Maybe the world could be ours tonight
[Verse 2: Zendaya]
You think it's easy?
You think I don't want to run to you?
But there are mountains
And there are doors that we can't walk through
I know you're wonderin' why
Because we're able to be just you and me within these walls
But when we go outside
You're gonna wake up and see that it was hopeless after all

[Chorus: Zendaya]
No one can rewrite the stars
How can you say you'll be mine?
Everything keeps us apart
And I'm not the one you were meant to find
It's not up to you, it's not up to me
When everyone tells us what we can be
How can we rewrite the stars?
Say that the world can be ours tonight

[Bridge: Both, Zendaya, Zac Efron]

All I want is to fall with you
So just give me all of you

Slide on it pimp game with my pinky ring

Why you claim that you rich? That's a false claim
I be straight to the whip, no baggage claim
Whole lotta styles, can't even pronounce the name
You ain't got no style, see you on my Instagram
I be rockin' it like it's fresh out the pan
Only when I'm takin' pics, I'm the middleman
Walk, talk it like a boss, I just lift a hand
Three million cash, call me Rain Man
Money like a shower, that's my rain dance
And we all in black, like it's Gangland
Say the wrong words, you be hangman
Watch me stick to your bitch like a spray tan

We'll find the start of something new
(Oh, we'll find the start of something new)
Just take me anywhere (Anywhere), take me anywhere (Anywhere)
Anywhere away with you (Anywhere, anywhere, anywhere, oh)
Just take me anywhere, take me anywhere (Oh, take me anywhere, love)
Anywhere away with you (Anywhere, anywhere, anywhere)
[Outro]
Fun, little less fun
Little less, over, over, over, over, me
(Anywhere away with you)
Me-me-me, me, me-me-me, me, me, me, me
