Shout out to Saweetie

That's my best friend, she a real bad bitch
Got her own money, she don't need no nig'
On the dance floor, she had two, three drinks
Now she twerkin', she throw it out and come back in

Now she twerkin', she throw it out and come back in

[Bridge: Saweetie]
Beep beep, is that my bestie in a Tessie?
Fresh blow out, skin on ten, ooh, she ready
Bitch, you look goodt, with a T at the end
I'ma hype her every time, that my motherfuckin' friend
She been down since the jellies and the bobos
Now we steppin' out the Jeep in Manolo's
When we pull up to the scene, they be filled with jealousy
If a bitch get finicky, she gon' bring that energy (Pop-pop-pop)
I hit her phone with the tea, like, "Bitch, guess what?
All the rich-ass boys wanna fuck on us!"
All this ass sittin' up, you could look, don't touch
In our bag, bust some bands every time we link up

[Chorus: Doja Cat, Saweetie, Chanmina]
That's my best friend, she a real bad bitch
Got her own money, she don't need no nig'
On the dance floor, she had two, three drinks
Now she twerkin', she throw it out and come back in
That's my best friend (Best friend), she a real bad bitch
Drive her own car, she don't need no Lyft
In the strip club, know my girl gon' tip (Yeah, yeah)
Now she twerkin', she throw it out and come back in
Hah, saweetie
[Outro: Saweetie & Chanmina]
Hah, best friend, you the baddest and you know it (You know)
Uh-oh, girl I think our booty growin' (Ayy, yeah)
Fuck it up in the mirror, hit them poses (Pose)
Best friend, damn, you motherfuckin' glowin' (Woa-oh)
Best friend, damn, your wrist look like it's frozen
Uh-oh, girl I think our booty growin' (Uh-oh)
Fuck it up in the mirror, hit them poses (Hit the pose)
Best friend, you my motherfuckin' soulmate (Soulmate)Embed
