They ain't got nowhere to go, I shot up everywhere they was (Blrrrd)
Yeah, you know who took that shit from you (Blrrrd), come get it back in blood (Blrrrd, blrrrd)
Bitch, come get it back in blood (Big blrrrd)

If your nigga killer ain't dead, you shouldn't wear no R.I.P. shirt (Nope)
Wе had three hundred shots up in the car beforе we picked up Durk (3Hunna)
You niggas who? Ain't got shit goin', go grab a glizzy, get alert (Alert)
Shiesty G post "R.I.P." and reason he in the dirt (On slime, blrrrd, blrrrd)
You gotta know I go too far (Let's go)
It's two O's up on this hundred, one of 'em might stand for O'Block (Blrrrd)
'Bout twenty some shots left up in the K, fifteen still in the Glock (The glizzy)
Keep my door unlocked and stop, I like gettin' on feet, park the car (Stop, stop), blrrrd (Park the car, blrrrd)
We gettin' up close, do him dirty, I ain't showin' love (Nope)
Eleven thousand all ones left my right pocket in the club (On God)
