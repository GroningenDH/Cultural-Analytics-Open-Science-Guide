“Noob” - Roblox Parody of “Mood” by 24kGoldn ft. Iann Dior LyricsWhy you always such a noob
Walking round, acting brand new
I don't wanna see you yelling oof
But you ain't got a clue
Afk and lagging out too
Running 'round in yellow green and blue
Why you always such a noob
Walking round, acting brand new
I don't wanna see you yelling oof
But you ain't got a clue
Afk and lagging out too
Running 'round in yellow green and blue
Now i'm on the golden gun
Going for that arsenal dub
Somehow never got my builder's club
Newbie, i'm not an oder
Won't you ever understand
I only simp for builderman
Boy it's obvious that you're such a noob
Laggy internet that you barely move
And you love dying in murder mystery 2
Now i'm tired of you acting so confused
We play games we love and have fun with our free time
We've fallen before but we laugh in the meantime
Why you always such a noob
Walking round, acting brand new
I don't wanna see you yelling oof
But you ain't got a clue
Afk and lagging out too
Running 'round in yellow green and blue
Why you always such a noob
Walking round, acting brand new
I don't wanna see you yelling oof
But you ain't got a clue
Afk and lagging out too
Running 'round in yellow green and blue
So why's it saying you're online but you don't show up
We could stick to playing the blox as we grow up
If i could then i would give you all my robux
But i'm sorry i can only give you bobux
I'm talking anthro
Arsenal, winning every bloxy
Finding every key to escape from the piggy
Got a tycoon, now i'm spitting out money
Got a simulator full of bees making honey
We play games we love and have fun with our free time
We've fallen before but we laugh in the meantime
Why you always such a noob
Walking round, acting brand new
I don't wanna see you yelling oof
But you ain't got a clue
Afk and lagging out too
Running 'round in yellow green and blue
Why you always such a noob
Walking round, acting brand new
I don't wanna see you yelling oof
But you ain't got a clue
Afk and lagging out too
Running 'round in yellow green and blue
