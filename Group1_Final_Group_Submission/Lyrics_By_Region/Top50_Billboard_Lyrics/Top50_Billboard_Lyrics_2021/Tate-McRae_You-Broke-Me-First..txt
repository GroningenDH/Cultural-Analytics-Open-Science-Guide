You broke me first

[Verse 1]
Maybe you don't like talking too much about yourself
But you shoulda told me that you were thinking 'bout someone else
You're drunk at a party or maybe it's just that your car broke down
Your phone's been off for a couple of months, so you're calling me now
[Pre-Chorus]
I know you, you're like this
When shit don't go your way, you needed me to fix it
And like me, I did
But I ran out of every reason

[Chorus]
Now suddenly, you're asking for it back
Could you tell me, where'd you get the nerve?
Yeah, you could say you miss all that we had
But I don't really care how bad it hurts
When you broke me first
You broke me first

[Verse 2]
Took a while, was in denial when I first heard
That you moved on quicker than I could've ever, you know that hurt
Swear for a while, I would stare at my phone just to see your name
But now that it's there, I don't really know what to say
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I know you, you're like this
When shit don't go your way, you needed me to fix it
And like me, I did
But I ran out of every reason

[Chorus]
Now suddenly, you're asking for it back
Could you tell me, where'd you get the nerve?
Yeah, you could say you miss all that we had
But I don't really care how bad it hurts
When you broke me first
You broke me first
[Bridge]
What did you think would happen?
What did you think would happen?
I'll never let you have it
What did you think would happen?

[Chorus]
Now suddenly, you're asking for it back
Could you tell me, where'd you get the nerve?
Yeah, you could say you miss all that we had
But I don't really care how bad it hurts
When you broke me first
You broke me first (You broke me first)
You broke me first, ooh-oh71Embed
