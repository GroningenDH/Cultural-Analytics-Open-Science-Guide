TranslationsPortuguÃªsMine Lyrics[Intro]
Huh, yeah, naw I just, had a lil' bit too much of Hennessy
Just gotta tell you how I feel, look

[Verse 1]
You so fuckin' precious when you smile (Haha, yeah)
Hit it from the back and drive you wild (Yeah-yeah)
Girl, I lose myself up in those eye-eye-eye-eye-eyes (Haha)
I just had to let you know you're mine (Mine, mine, mine)

[Chorus]
Hands on your body, I don't wanna waste no time (Time, time, time)
Feels like forever even if forever's tonight
Just lay with me, waste this night away with me
You're mine, I can't look away, I just gotta say

[Verse 2]
I'm so fucking happy you're alive (Haha, yeah)
Swear to God, I'm down if you're down, all you gotta say is "Right" (Yeah-yeah)
Girl, anything I can do just to make you feel alright
Oh, oh, oh, oh, I just had to let you know you're fine
Running circles 'round my mind
Even when it's rainy, all you ever do is shine
You on fire, you a star just like Mariah
Man, this feel incredible, I'll turn you into a bride
You're mine (Mine, mine, mine)

(Oh-uh-oh)
Hands on your body, I don't wanna waste no time (Time, time, time)
Feels like forever even if forever's tonight
Just lay with me, waste this night away with me
You're mine, I can't look away, I just gotta say150Embed
