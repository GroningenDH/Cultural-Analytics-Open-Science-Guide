LOVE, Finesse & Filthy Mashup LyricsLOVE. by Kendrick Lamar ft. Zacari

If I didn't ride blade on curb, would you still love me?
If I minimized my net worth, would you still love me?
Keep it a hundred, I'd rather you trust me than to love me
Keep it a whole one hund': don't got you, I got nothin'

Yeah, I got somethin' somethin'
Hol' up, we gon' function, no assumptions
Feelin' like Tyson with it
Knock it out twice, I'm with it
Only for the night, I'm kiddin'
Yeah only for life, you're a homie for life
You're a homie for life, let's get it
Hit that shoulder lean
I know what comin' over mean
Backstroke oversea
I know what you need
Already on ten, our money come in
All feeling go out, this feeling don't drought
This party won't end

Finesse (Remix) by Bruno Mars ft. Cardi B

Out here drippin' in finesse
It don't make no sense
Out here drippin' in finesse
You know it, you know it
Out here drippin' in finesse
It don't make no sense
Out here drippin' in finesse
You know it, you know it
You might also likeDrop top Porsche, Rollie' on my wrist
Diamonds up and down my chain
Cardi B, straight stuntin', can't tell me nothin'
Bossed up and I changed the game
It's my big Bronx boogie, got all them girls shook
Big, fat ass got all them girls hooked
I went from dollar bills, now we poppin' rubber bands
Baby let me sing to you, while you do your money dance like ayy
Flexin' on the 'Gram like ayy
Hit the Lil' Jon, okay, okay
Yeah, we drippin' in finesse but haters gonna say it's fake

Filthy by Justin Timberlake

So real
Haters gonna say
It's fake
So real

So put your filthy hands all over me
You know this ain't the clean version
Na na na na na nana
No question, I want it, fired up, everybody smokin'
Your friends, my friends and they ain't leaving till six in the morning

Baby you the coldest
Gold form, put em on, oh this
You don't wanna walk through shit
So Baby, don't you mind if I do, yeah
Exactly what you like times two, yeah
You got me singing, "ooh, na na na na na nana"
So, baby, don't you mind if I do

Mixed

Cause we out here drippin' in finesse
Just love me
You know it, you know it
We out here drippin' in finesse
Just love meEmbed
