No Guidance - Chris Brown ft. Drake (Devvon Terrell Cover) Lyrics[Intro: Devvon Terrell]
My name is Devvon Terrell
This is a raw session
You know the vibes

[Verse: Devvon Terrell]
Trips that you plan for the next whole week
Bands too long for a nigga so cheap
And your flex OD, and your sex OD
You got it, girl, you got it (Oh)
Oh lemme tell you
You got it, girl, you got it
You should deal with a five star nigga
Know you work more than just 6 figures
I'm applying the pressure my finger on the trigger
I know you got a roster just full of hittas
But you need a first line up like Kawhi to the Clippers
Been through so much shit that you don't even know the difference
Made so many mental notes that you can't save a picture
Got so many cuts and bruises I was still invested
Still treat you like the best like KD to the Nets

[Bridge: Devvon Terrell]
I see you and I know you legit (Yeah)
High off you, I need a fix (Yeah)
You a hot girl I'm off this lukewarm
That's like comparing you to a groupon chile
You might also like[Chorus: Devvon Terrell]
You got it, girl, you got it (Aye)
You got it, girl, you got itEmbed
