Savage Love (Laxed - Siren Beat) [BTS Remix] Lyrics[Intro]
BTS

[Chorus: Jung Kook]
Savage love, did somebody, did somebody break your heart?
Lookin' like an angel, but you're savage, love
When you kiss me, I know you don't give two fucks
But I still want that

[Verse 1: Jason Derulo]
If I woke up without ya, I don't know what I would do
Thought I could be single forever 'til I met you
Usually don't be fallin', be fallin', fallin' fast
You got a way of keepin' me comin' back-to-back
I just found out, the only reason that you lovin' me
Was to get back at your ex lover but before you leave
Usually I would never, would never even care
Baby, I know she creepin', I feel it in the air

[Pre-Chorus: Jung Kook]
Every night and every day (And every day)
I try to make you stay, but you're...

[Chorus: Jung Kook]
Savage love, did somebody, did somebody break your heart?
Lookin' like an angel, but you're savage, love
When you kiss me, I know you don't give two fucks
But I still want that
You might also like[Post-Chorus: Jung Kook]
Your savage love
Your savage lo-lo-love
Your savage lo-lo-love
You could use me
'Cause I still want that

[Verse 2: SUGA]
사랑이란 어쩌면 순간의 감정의 나열
조건이 다들 붙지 난 뭘 사랑하는가
영원이라는 말은 어쩌면 모래성
잔잔한 파도 앞에 힘없이 무너져

[Verse 3: j-hope]
Every night, every day, I'm swept away by the waves
Don't know what I'm thinking (Can't get you outta my head)
내가 두려운게 그대이든 그때이든
불같이 사랑할래, uh, 그댈 지금

[Pre-Chorus: Jason Derulo]
Every night and every day
I try to make you stay, but you're...

[Chorus: Jason Derulo]
Savage love, did somebody, did somebody break your heart?
Lookin' like an angel, but you're savage, love
When you kiss me, I know you don't give two fucks
But I still want that
[Post-Chorus: Jason Derulo, Jung Kook]
Your savage love
Your savage lo-lo-love (Oh)
Your savage lo-lo-love
You could use me
'Cause I still want that, your savage love

[Bridge: Jason Derulo & BTS]
(Ooh la-la-la-la, ooh la-la-la-la)
Your savage lo-lo-love
(Ooh la-la-la-la, ooh la-la-la-la, ooh)
Your savage lo-lo-love
(Ooh la-la-la-la)
You could use me
(Ooh la-la-la-la)
Baby

[Chorus: Jung Kook]
Savage love (Oh, girl)
Did somebody, did somebody break your heart? (Break your heart)
Lookin' like an angel, but you're savage, love (Savage love, hey)
When you kiss me, I know you don't give two fucks
But I still want that

[Post-Chorus: Jung Kook, Jason Derulo]
Your savage love (Savage love)
Your savage lo-lo-love (Your savage lo-lo-love)
Your savage lo-lo-love
You could use me
'Cause I still want that, your savage love20Embed
