TranslationsDeutschNumb Little Bug Lyrics[Verse 1]
I don't feel a single thing
Have the pills done too much?
Haven't caught up with my friends in weeks
And now we're outta touch
I've been drivin' in L.A
And the world, it feels too big
Like a floating ball that's bound to break
Snap my psyche like a twig

[Pre-Chorus]
And I just wanna see
If you feel the same as me

[Chorus]
Do you ever get a little bit tired of life?
Like you're not really happy but you don't wanna die
Like you're hangin' by a thread but you gotta survive
'Cause you gotta survive
Like your body's in the room but you're not really there
Like you have empathy inside but you don't really care
Like you're fresh outta love but it's been in the air
Am I past repair?

[Post-Chorus]
A little bit tired of trying to care when I don't
A little bit tired of quick repairs to cope
A little bit tired of sinkin', there's water in my boat
I'm barely breathin', tryna stay afloat
So I got these quick repairs to cope
Guess I'm just broken and broke

The prescription's on its way
With a name I can't pronounce
And the dose I gotta take
Boy, I wish that I could count

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I just wanna see
If this could make me happy

[Chorus]
Do you ever get a little bit tired of life?
Like you're not really happy but you don't wanna die
Like you're hangin' by a thread but you gotta survive
'Cause you gotta survive
Like your body's in the room but you're not really there
Like you have empathy inside but you don't really care
Like you're fresh out of love but it's been in the air
Am I past repair?

[Post-Chorus]
A little bit tired of trying to care when I don't
A little bit tired of quick repairs to cope
A little bit tired of sinkin', there's water in my boat
I'm barely breathin', tryna stay afloat
So I got these quick repairs to cope
[Outro]
Do you ever get a little bit tired of life?
Like you're not really happy but you don't wanna die
Like a numb little bug that's gotta survive
That's gotta survive18Embed
