’Til You Can’t Lyrics[Verse 1]
You can tell your old man you'll do some large-mouth fishin' another time
You just got too much on your plate to bait and cast a line
You can always put a rain check in his hand
'Til you can't

[Verse 2]
You can keep puttin' off forever with that girl who's heart you hold
Swearin' that you'll ask someday further down the road
You can always put a diamond on her hand
'Til you can't

[Chorus]
If you got a chance take it
Take it while you got a chance
If you got a dream chase it
'Cause a dream won't chase you back
If you're gonna love somebody
Hold 'em as long and as strong and as close as you can
'Til you can't

[Verse 3]
There's a box of greasy parts sittin' in the trunk of that sixty-five
Still waitin' on you and your grandad to bring it back to life
You can always get around to fixin' up that Pontiac
'Til you can't

If you got a chance take it
Take it while you got a chancе
If you got a dream chase it
'Cause a drеam won't chase you back
If you're gonna love somebody
Hold 'em as long and as strong and as close as you can
'Til you can't

[Bridge]
So take that phone call from your mama
Just talk away
'Cause you'll never know how bad you wanna
'Til you can't some day
Don't wait on tomorrow 'cause tomorrow may not show
Say your sorry's, I love you's
'Cause, man, you never know

[Chorus]
If you got a chance take it
Take it while you got a chance
If you got a dream chase it
'Cause a dream won't chase you back
If you're gonna love somebody
Hold 'em as long and as strong and as close as you can
'Til you can't
Yeah, if you got a chance take it (Take it)
Take it while you got a chance
If you got a dream chase it
'Cause a dream won't chase you back
If you're gonna love somebody
Hold 'em as long and as strong and as close as you can
'Til you can't
'Til you can't
[Outro]
Yeah
Take it1Embed
