Anyway

[Verse 1]
It's bad bitch o'clock, yeah, it's thick-thirty
I've been through a lot, but I'm still flirty (Okay)
Is everybody back up in the buildin'?
It's been a minute, tell me how you're healin'
'Cause I'm about to get into my feelings
How you feelin'? How you feel right now?

I'm way too fine to be this stressed, yeah
Oh, I'm not the girl I was or used to be, uh
Bitch, I might be better
