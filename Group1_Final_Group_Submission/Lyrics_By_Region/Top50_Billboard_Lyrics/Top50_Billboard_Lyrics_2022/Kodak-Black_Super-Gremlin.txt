Super Gremlin Lyrics[Intro]
Well, we could be superstars
We been rather wreckin' cars (Ayy bro, is that Jambo?)
What is at stakes for us?
Kickin' off power mirrors
Yeah, we could be superstars
But I'm pretty sure our time is up
And so we fell off the spinning tops
Don't know, maybe for trial (ATL Jacob, ATL Jacob)
But way more error (Huh)

[Verse 1]
Say you my nigga, I'ma be your killer
Nobody gon' play with you when I'm with you
Go against any nigga, like, fuck this glitter
Skeet off third, I'm busy
I put it in for you, I spinned for you
Whatever you with, I'm with it
How you gon' cross a nigga that was rockin' with you? I got you lit in the city
I been multitaskin', rappin' and bein' a daddy to my lil' children
I been standin' on business, and spinnin' and spinnin' and spinnin' until I'm dizzy
I do all the smackin', you ain't never stepped or helped with none of this killin'
You doin' lot of cappin', watch whеn I catch you, I'ma whack you in front the witness

[Chorus]
Damn, my nigga, you trippin'
We could'vе been superstars
Remember when we was jackin' cars
Now, it's not safe for you
You switched like a pussy, lil' bitch
Damn, my nigga, you trippin'
We could've been superstars
Can't help it, now I'm reminiscing
Remember when we was jackin' cars
Now, you better keep your distance
'Cause it's not safe for you
You switched like a pussy, lil' bitch
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
Trackhawk with the kit, snatch off on the bitch
When I slide, nightlight on the blick, bet I'm on my shit when I'm outside
Zoe done ran down, caught him pants down, nigga, you shitted
I knew the Perc' was fake, but I still ate it 'cause I'm a gremlin

[Verse 2]
Yeah, Kutthroat business, KTB, backdoor wide open
Wait 'til my sniper get loud, all you niggas gon' die, time rollin'
Bustin' on my opponent, no half-steppin', crushin' my opps totally
We was just broke with no motion
Sleepin' on sofas, creepin' in houses like roaches
I done went cages, to stages, to cages
Now free me, baby, can't keep me, baby
I beat them cases, they already hate me
They gon' want me dead when I'm off probation
Oh, y'all think lil' Yak retarded?
Y'all ain't seen nothin' yet, I promise
Niggas can't take me, niggas can't guard me
I be on a fuck nigga ass like Charmin
AK, twenty-inch carbon

[Chorus]
We could've been superstars
Remember when we was jackin' cars
Now, it's not safe for you
You switched like a pussy, lil' bitch
Damn, my nigga, you trippin'
We could've been superstars
Can't help it, now I'm reminiscing
Remember when we was jackin' cars
Now, you better keep your distance
'Cause it's not safe for you
You switched like a pussy, lil' bitch
[Post-Chorus]
Trackhawk with the kit, snatch off on the bitch
When I slide, nightlight on the blick, bet I'm on my shit when I'm outside
Zoe done ran down, caught him pants down, nigga, you shitted
I knew the Perc' was fake, but I still ate it 'cause I'm a gremlin

[Outro]
—Glass
Yeah, we could be superstars (Super Gremlin)
But I'm pretty sure our time is up (Now your time is up)
And so we fell off the spinning tops
Don't know, maybe for trial
But way more error
I ain't slimy, I'm grimy
Any way you put it, I'm SG with it, I'm Super Gremlin
Snatch and grab, sneak and geek, Sniper Gang, trust
Nightmare, baby, you know I—
I bet you always see me in your dreams
