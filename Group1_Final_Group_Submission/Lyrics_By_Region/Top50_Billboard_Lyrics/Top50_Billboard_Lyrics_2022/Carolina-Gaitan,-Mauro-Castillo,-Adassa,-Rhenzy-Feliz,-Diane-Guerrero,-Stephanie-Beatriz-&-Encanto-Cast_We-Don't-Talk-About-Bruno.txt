We don't talk about Bruno, no, no, no
We don't talk about Bruno, but

[Verse 1: Pepa & Félix]
It was my wedding day (It was our wedding day)
We were getting ready
And there wasn't a cloud in the sky (No clouds allowed in the sky)
Bruno walks in with a mischievous grin (Thunder)
You telling this story or am I? (I'm sorry, mi vida, go on)
Bruno says, "It looks like rain" (Why did he tell us?)
In doing so, he floods my brain (Abuela, get the umbrellas)
Married in a hurricane (What a joyous day, but anyway)

[Chorus: Pepa & Félix, Dolores]
We don't talk about Bruno, no, no, no (We don't talk about Bruno, no)
We don't talk about Bruno (Hey)

[Verse 2: Dolores & Camilo]
Grew to live in fear of Bruno stuttering or stumbling
I can always hear him sort of muttering and mumbling
I associate him with the sound of falling sand (Ch, ch, ch)
It's a heavy lift with a gift so humbling
Always left Abuela and the family fumbling
Grappling with prophecies they couldn't understand
Do you understand?
A seven-foot frame, rats along his back
When he calls your name, it all fades to black
Yeah, he sees your dreams and feasts on your screams (Hey)
You might also like[Chorus: Pepa, Félix & Camilo, Dolores]
We don't talk about Bruno, no, no, no (No, no)
We don't talk about Bruno (We don't talk about Bruno)

[Verse 3: Ensemble,  Señora Pezmuerto, Osvaldo & Townsperson 3]
He told me my fish would die
The next day, dead (No, no)
He told me I'd grow a gut
And just like he said (No, no)
He said that all my hair would disappear
Now, look at my head (No, no)
Your fate is sealed when your prophecy is read

[Verse 4: Isabela, Abuela & Dolores]
He told me that the life of my dreams
Would be promised and someday be mine
He told me that my power would grow
Like the grapes that thrive on the vine (Óye, Mariano's on his way)
He told me that the man of my dreams
Would be just out of reach, betrothed to another
It's like I hear him now (Hey sis)
I want not a sound out of you (It's like I can hear him now)
I can hear him now

[Verse 5: Mirabel, Camilo, Abuela & Isabela]
Um, Bruno
Yeah, about that Bruno
I really need to know about Bruno
Gimme the truth and the whole truth, Bruno
Isabela, your boyfriend's here
Time for dinner
[Verse 6]

[Pepa, Félix, Dolores, Camilo, & (Isabela)]
It was my wedding day, we were getting ready; it was our wedding day; grew to live in fear of Bruno stuttering or stumbling, I can always hear him sort of muttering and mumbling; a seven-foot frame, rats along his back; (He told me that the life of my dreams)

And there wasn't a cloud in the sky; no clouds allowed in the sky; I associate him with the sound of falling sand, ch, ch, ch; when he calls your name, it all fades to black; (Would be promised and someday be mine)

Bruno walks in with a mischievous grin; thunder; it's a heavy lift with a gift so humbling, always left Abuela and the family fumbling; yeah, he sees your dreams and feasts on your screams; (He told me that my power would grow)

You telling this story or am I?; I'm sorry, mi vida, go on; grappling with prophecies they couldn't understand, do you understand?; (Like the grapes that thrive on the vine, I'm fine)

[Abuela]
Óye, Mariano's on his way

[Pepa, Félix, Dolores, Camilo, & (Isabela)]
Bruno says, "It looks like rain"; why did he tell us?; he told me that the man of my dreams; a seven-foot frame, rats along his back; (He told me that the life of my dreams)

In doing so, he floods my brain; Abuela, get the umbrellas; would be just out of reach, betrothed to another, another; when he calls your name, it all fades to black; (Would be promised and someday be mine)

Married in a hurricane; what a joyous day, but anyway; And I'm fine, and I'm fine, and I'm fine, I'll be fine; yeah, he sees your dreams and feasts on your screams; (And I'm fine, and I'm fine, and I'm fine, I'm fine)

[All]
He's here

[Outro: All & Mirabel]
