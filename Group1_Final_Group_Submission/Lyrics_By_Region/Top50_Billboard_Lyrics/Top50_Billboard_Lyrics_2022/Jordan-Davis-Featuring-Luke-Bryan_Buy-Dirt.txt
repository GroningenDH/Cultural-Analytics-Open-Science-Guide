Buy Dirt Lyrics[Verse 1: Jordan Davis]
Few days before he turned 80
He was sitting out back in a rocker
He said "What you been up to lately?"
I told him chasing a dollar
And in between sips of coffee
He poured this wisdom out
Said "If you want my two cents on making a dollar count

[Chorus: Jordan Davis]
Buy dirt
Find the one you can't live without
Get a ring, let your knee hit the ground
Do what you love but call it work
And throw a little money in the plate at church
Send your prayers up and your roots down deep
Add a few limbs to your family tree
And watch their pencils marks, and the grass in the yard
All grow up
'Cause the truth about it is it all goes by real quick
You can't buy happiness
But you can buy dirt"

[Verse 2: Luke Bryan]
Before you get caught on that ladder
Let me tell you what it's all about
Find you a few things that matter
That you can put a fence around
And then he laid it out
You might also like[Chorus: Jordan Davis & Luke Bryan]
Buy dirt
Find the one you can't live without
Get a ring, let your knee hit the ground
Do what you love but call it work
And throw a little money in the plate at church
Send you prayers up and your roots down deep
And add a few limbs to your family tree
And watch their pencils marks, and the grass in the yard
All grow up
'Cause the truth about it is it all goes by real quick
You can't buy happiness
But you can buy dirt

[Bridge: Jordan Davis & Luke Bryan]
You can buy dirt
And thank the good Lord for it
'Cause He ain't makin' any more of it

[Chorus: Jordan Davis, Luke Bryan, Both ]
So buy dirt
Find the one you can't live without
Get a ring, let your knee hit the ground
Do what you love but call it work
And throw a little money in the plate at church
Send your prayers up and your roots down deep
Add a few limbs to your family tree
And watch their pencils marks, and the grass in the yard
All grow up
'Cause the truth about it is it all goes by real quick
You can't buy happiness
But you can buy dirt6Embed
