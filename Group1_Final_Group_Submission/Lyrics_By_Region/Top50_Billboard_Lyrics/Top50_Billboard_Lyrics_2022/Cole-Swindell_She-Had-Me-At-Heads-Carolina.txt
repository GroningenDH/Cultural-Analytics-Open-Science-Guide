She Had Me At Heads Carolina Lyrics[Intro]
(Heads Carolina, tails California)

[Verse 1]
I was out with the boys, catchin' up in a neon light
Didn't know 'til we walked in it was karaoke night
She was in a circle of girls, chasin' a shot with a lime
She was laughin', they were darin' her to get on the mic
One of 'em walked up and turned in her name
Next thing I knew, man, she was up on the stage, singin'

[Chorus]
"Heads Carolina, tails California"
Maybe she'd fall for a boy from South Georgia
She's got the bar in the palm of her hand
And she's a '90s country fan like I am
Hey, I got a Chevy, she can flip a quarter
I'd drive hеr anywhere from herе to California
When this song is over, I gotta find her
'Cause she had me at "Heads Carolina"

[Verse 2]
Yeah, she knew every word by heart, didn't need no screen, no
I was raisin' my glass up for her, I saw her smilin' at me, yeah
She had me down in the front by the end of verse two
Like there wasn't no one else in the room, we were singin'
You might also like[Chorus]
"Heads Carolina, tails California"
Maybe she'd fall for a boy from South Georgia
She's got the bar in the palm of her hand
And she's a '90s country fan like I am
Hey, I got a Chevy, she can flip a quarter
I'd drive her anywhere from here to California
When this song is over, I gotta find her
'Cause she had me at "Heads Carolina"

[Bridge]
Yeah, I bought her a round and we talked 'til the lights came on
I still see that girl every time I hear that song

[Chorus]
"Heads Carolina, tails California"
Maybe she'd fall for a boy from South Georgia
She's got the bar in the palm of her hand
And she's a '90s country fan like I am
Hey, I got a Chevy, she can flip a quarter
I'd drive her anywhere from here to California
When this song is over, I gotta find her
'Cause she had me at "Heads Carolina"

[Outro]
(Heads Carolina, tails California)
Yeah, she had me at "Heads Carolina" (Somewhere greener, somewhere warmer)
(Heads Carolina, tails California)
Yeah (Somewhere greener, somewhere warmer)
(Heads Carolina)
(Somewhere together, I've got a quarter)
(Heads Carolina, tails California)1Embed
