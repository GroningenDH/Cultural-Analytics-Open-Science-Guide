I wish I knew you wanted me
I wish I knew
I wish I knew you wanted me
I wish I knew
I wish I knew you wanted me

[Verse 1: Steve Lacy]
What you, ooh, uh, what you do?
Made a move, could've made a move
If I knew I'd be with you
Is it too late to pursue?

[Chorus: Steve Lacy]
I bite my tongue, it's a bad habit
Kinda mad that I didn't take a stab at it
Thought you were too good for me, my dear
Never gave me time of day, my dear
It's okay, things happen for
Reasons that I think are sure, yeah

Please say to me (Please, just say to me)
If you still want it
I wish you wouldn't play with me
I wanna know (I wanna know)

[Chorus: Steve Lacy]
Can I bite your tongue like my bad habit?
Would you mind if I tried to make a pass at it?
No, you're not too good for me, my dear
Funny you come back to me, my dear
It's okay, things happen for
Reasons that I can't ignore, yeah

[Bridge: Steve Lacy]
You can't surprise a Gemini (I wish I knew)
I'm everywhere, I'm cross-eyed, and (I wish I knew you wanted me)
Now that you're back, I can't decide (I wish I knew)
If I decide if you're invited (I wish I knew you wanted me)
You always knew the way to wow me
Fuck around, get tongue-tied, and
I turn it on, I make it rowdy
Then carry on, but I'm not hidin'
You grabbin' me hard 'cause you know what you found
It's biscuits, it's gravy, babe
[Instrumental Break]

[Outro: Steve Lacy, Steve Lacy & Fousheé]
You can't surprise a Gemini
But you know it's biscuits, it's gravy, babe
I knew you'd come back around
'Cause you know it's biscuits, it's gravy, babe
Let's fuck in the back of the mall, lose control
Go stupid, go crazy, babe
I know I'll be in your heart 'til the end
You'll miss me, don't beg me, babe21Embed
