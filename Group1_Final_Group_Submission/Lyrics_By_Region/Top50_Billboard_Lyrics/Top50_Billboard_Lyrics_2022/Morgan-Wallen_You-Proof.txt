You Proof Lyrics[Verse 1]
Yeah, I've been throwin' down the whiskey
I ought to get my money back
Someone said it drowns the memory
Aw, but it ain't doin' jack
Yeah, I've been sippin', I've been buzzin'
Shootin' doubles like it's nothin'
Aw, but nothin' makes you go away

[Chorus]
I need something "You proof"
Something stronger than I'm used to
Yeah, I've been pullin' 90 to 100
Feel like nothing's gonna cut it, that's the hard truth
Yeah, I need something "You proof"
Aw, I need something "You proof"

[Verse 2]
Poured 'em up 'til they're shutting 'em down, yeah
You never ain't not around, yeah
Don't matter what time or town, I can't get you gone
Turned the bar, yeah, upside down
Just lookin' for somethin' that does it
I'd give up all my money

[Chorus]
Ain't nobody sellin' nothin' "You proof"
Something stronger than I'm used to
Yeah, I've been pullin' 90 to 100
Feel like nothing's gonna cut it, that's the hard truth
Yeah, I need something "You proof"
Aw, I need something "You proof"

Hey, I've been mixing liquors tryin' to get you gone
Aw, but I must be doing somethin' wrong
'Cause I've been working hard to fade your memory
Baby, but the only thing faded is me

[Chorus]
I need something "You proof"
Something stronger than I'm used to
Yeah, I've been pullin' 90 to 100
Feel like nothing's gonna cut it, that's the hard truth
I need something "You proof" (Poured 'em up 'til they're shutting 'em down, yeah)
Aw, I need something "You proof" (You never ain't not around, yeah)

[Outro]
Don't matter what time or town, I can't get you gone
Turned the bar, yeah, upside down
Just lookin' for somethin' that does it
I'd give up all my money
Ain't nobody sellin' nothin' "You proof"3Embed
