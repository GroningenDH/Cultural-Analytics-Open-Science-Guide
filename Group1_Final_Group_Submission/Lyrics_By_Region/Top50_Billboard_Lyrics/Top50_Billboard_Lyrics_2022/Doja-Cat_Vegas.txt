Yeah, ah, get it
Yeah, ah, get it
Yeah, yeah, ah, get it

[Chorus: Doja Cat, Shonka Dukureh]
You ain't nothin' but a
Dog, player, ah, get it
Fraud, player, ah, get it
I understand, I understand
You ain't the man, you ain't a man
You ain't nothin' but a
Hound dog, hound dog, hound dog
You ain't nothin' but a

[Verse 1: Doja Cat, Shonka Dukureh]
Player gettin' valeted around in that ho whip
Two fingers up, one down with my toes ten
Flewed out with my boobs out, put a cork in it
Love it when you be cryin' out when I'm corseted
I don't think he gon' make it, do not let me start ragin'
****, I'm losin' my patience, this ain't stayin' in Vegas (You ain't nothin' but a)
There's more sides to the story, I'ma tell everybody
Had your ass sittin' courtside with your arm around me
Had your ass sittin' first class with your burnt ass out in Abu Dhabi
Coulda been what we shoulda been
But you lost a bet, now you gotta find me
Find a seat
I ain't playin', that's hide and seek
High school when you finally peaked
Hound dog, come find a treat
I'm a bad bitch, but

Dog, player, ah, get it
Fraud, player, ah, get it
I understand, I understand
You ain't the man, you ain't a man
You ain't nothin' but a
Hound dog, hound dog, hound dog (Yeah, yeah, said)
You ain't nothin' but a

[Verse 2: Doja Cat, Shonka Dukureh]
I get it, I know you got some other **** you wanted
I get it, you needed someone that could prove you wrong
So I reckon you leave all of your problems at the door to my city
You gon' need to tell my brothers where you from
And I admit it, I still got empathy
And you gon' feel it for two weeks when I release you in them sheets (You ain't nothin' but a)
And keep my meanin' discreet, keep the cleanin' my gym
Then put that Yeezy in your teeth, let my demons off they leashes
If you even think to speak, I'ma give a whole new meanin'
When you said you live in a dream, we can keep that **** asleep
And you gon' laugh with all your Gs
Countin' them sheep, sheep, sheep, sheep
Talkin' 'bout Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z, R.I.P

[Chorus: Doja Cat, Shonka Dukureh]
You ain't nothin' but a
Dog, player, ah, get it
Fraud, player, ah, get it
I understand, I understand
You ain't the man, you ain't a man
You ain't nothin' but a
Hound dog, hound dog, hound dog
You ain't nothin' but a
Dog, player, ah, get it
Fraud, player, ah, get it
I understand, I understand
You ain't the man, you ain't a man
You ain't nothin' but a
Hound dog, hound dog, hound dog
You ain't nothin' but a
