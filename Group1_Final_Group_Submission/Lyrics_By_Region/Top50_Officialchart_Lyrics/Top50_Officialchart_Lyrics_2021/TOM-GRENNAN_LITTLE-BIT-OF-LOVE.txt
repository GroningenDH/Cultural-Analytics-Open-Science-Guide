Little Bit of Love Lyrics[Chorus]
I've been holdin' onto pieces, swimmin' in the deep end
Tryna find my way back to you 'cause I'm needin'
A little bit of love
A little bit of love, a little bit of love

[Verse 1]
Lately I've been countin' stars
And I'm sorry that I broke your heart
It's somethin' that I didn't want for you
But I'm steppin' on broken glass
And I know this is my final chance
All I'm tryna do is find my path to you

[Pre-Chorus]
I've got voices in my head and there's a deafening silence
I've got voices in my head and I can't lie

[Chorus]
I've been holdin' onto pieces, swimmin' in the deep end
Tryna find my way back to you 'cause I'm needin'
A little bit of love
A little bit of love, I need a little love
Just like the air I'm breathin', these open wounds ain't healin'
Tryna find my way back to you 'cause I'm needin'
A little bit of love
A little bit of love, a little bit of love, a little bit of love
You might also like[Verse 2]
Lately, I've been wakin' up
In a dreamy state calling your name
Stayed up too late just thinkin' of you
Now I'm knocking on every door
'Cause I heard you moved from twenty-two
Has it been that long? I guess time just flew

[Pre-Chorus]
I've got voices in my head and there's a deafening silence
I've got voices in my head and I can't lie

[Chorus]
I've been holding onto pieces, swimmin' in the deep end
Tryna find my way back to you 'cause I'm needin'
A little bit of love
A little bit of love, I need a little love
Just like the air I'm breathin', these open wounds ain't healin'
Tryna find my way back to you 'cause I'm needin'
A little bit of love
A little bit of love, a little bit of love, a little bit of love

[Bridge]
I tried to fly but I used my wings too soon
Now everything got me thinking of you
I tried a million times to cut you loose
[Chorus]
I've been holding onto pieces, swimmin' in the deep end
Tryna find my way back to you 'cause I'm needin'
A little bit of love
A little bit of love, I need a little love
Just like the air I'm breathin', these open wounds ain't healin'
Tryna find my way back to you 'cause I'm needin'
A little bit of love
A little bit of love, a little bit of love, a little bit of love2Embed
