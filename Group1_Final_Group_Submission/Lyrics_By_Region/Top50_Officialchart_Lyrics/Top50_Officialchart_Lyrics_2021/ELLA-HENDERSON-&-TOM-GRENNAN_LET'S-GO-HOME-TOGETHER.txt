TranslationsEnglishLet’s Go Home Together Lyrics[Verse 1: Ella Henderson]
I'd never have given you a second look
But I like the way you don't give a damn
You seem like someone I could pick a fight with
And dance all night with
Maybe you'll like me the way I am

[Pre-Chorus: Ella Henderson]
And even though you got bad tattoos and smell like booze
I'm into you
Even though you got an attitude
Baby, I'm in love

[Chorus: Ella Henderson, Tom Grennan, Both]
I've said a little too much
I'm a little bit drunk
Feels like I know you so well
You could be everything that I've been missing
I'm coming out of my shell
And I never do that
How did you do that?
It's like I've known you my whole life
So what, we're a littlе drunk
Let's go home togethеr (Yeah, yeah)
Let's go home together

I'm never that good in a crowded room, hmm
But everything stopped when I just saw you
You seem like someone I could be myself with, no defenses
Maybe you like me the way I am, hmm

[Pre-Chorus: Tom Grennan & Ella Henderson, Tom Grennan]
Even though you talk way too fast
I can't stop looking at your eyes
Heads turn every time you laugh
Baby, I'm in love

[Chorus: Tom Grennan & Ella Henderson, Tom Grennan]
I've said a little too much
I'm a little bit drunk
Feels like I know you so well
You could be everything that I've been missing
I'm coming out of my shell
And I never do that
How did you do that?
It's like I've known you my whole life
So what, we're a little drunk
Let's go home together (Yeah)
Let's go home together

[Bridge: Ella Henderson, Tom Grennan, Both]
I'm a little drunk
Need a little love (Aah)
You could be everything, that I've been missing
You could be everything to me
I'm a little drunk
Need a little love (Hmm, yeah)
Could be everything, that I've been missing
Baby, I'm in love (Love)
[Chorus: Tom Grennan & Ella Henderson]
I've said a little too much
