Astronaut

[Chorus]
What you know about rollin' down in the deep?
When your brain goes numb, you can call that mental freeze
When these people talk too much, put that shit in slow motion, yeah
I feel like an astronaut in the ocean, ayy
What you know about rollin' down in the deep?
When your brain goes numb, you can call that mental freeze
When these people talk too much, put that shit in slow motion, yeah
I feel like an astronaut in the ocean

[Verse 1]
She say that I'm cool (Damn straight)
I'm like, "Yeah, that's true" (That's true)
I believe in G-O-D (Ayy)
Don't believe in T-H-O-T
She keep playing me dumb (Play me)
I'ma play her for fun (Uh-huh)
Y'all don't really know my mental
Let me give you the picture like stencil
Fallin' out in a drought
No flow, rain wasn't pourin' down (Pourin' down)
See, that pain was all around
See, my mode was kinda lounged
Didn't know which, which way to turn
Flow was cool but I still felt burnt
Energy up, you can feel my surge
I'ma kill everything like this purge (Ayy)
You might also like[Bridge]
Let's just get this straight for a second, I'ma work (Yuh)
Even if I don't get paid for progression, I'ma get it (Uh, get it)
Everything that I do is electric (Ayy)
I'ma keep it in a motion, keep it movin' like kinetic, ayy (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
Put this shit in a frame, better know I don't blame
Everything that I say, man, I seen you deflate
Let me elevate, this ain't a prank
Have you walkin' on a plank, li-li-li-li-like
Both hands together, God, let me pray (Now let me pray), uh
I've been goin' right, right around, call that relay (Masked Wolf)
Pass the baton, back and I'm on
Swimmin' in the pool, Kendrick Lamar, uh (Ayy)
Want a piece of this, a piece of mine, my peace a sign
Can you please read between the lines?
My rhyme's inclined to break your spine (Spine)
They say that I'm so fine (Fine)
You could never match my grind (True)
Please do not, not waste my time (Wolf)

[Chorus]
What you know about rollin' down in the deep?
When your brain goes numb, you can call that mental freeze
When these people talk too much, put that shit in slow motion, yeah
I feel like an astronaut in the ocean, ayy
What you know about rollin' down in the deep?
When your brain goes numb, you can call that mental freeze
When these people talk too much, put that shit in slow motion, yeah
I feel like an astronaut in the ocean67Embed
