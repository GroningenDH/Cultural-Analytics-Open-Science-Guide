I get those goosebumps every time, yeah, you come around, yeah
You ease my mind, you make everything feel fine
Worried 'bout those comments
I'm way too numb, yeah, it's way too dumb, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time, I need the Heimlich
Throw that to the side, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time, yeah
When you're not around (Straight up)
When you throw that to the side, yeah (It's lit)
I get those goosebumps every time, yeah

[Verse 1]
7-1-3
Through the 2-8-1, yeah, I'm ridin', why they on me?
Why they on me? I'm flyin', sippin' low-key
I'm sippin' low-key in Onyx, rider, rider

[Chorus]
I get those goosebumps every time, yeah, you come around, yeah
You ease my mind, you make everything feel fine
Worried 'bout those comments
I'm way too numb, yeah, it's way too dumb, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time, I need the Heimlich
Throw that to the side, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time, yeah
When you're not around (Straight up)
When you throw that to the side, yeah (It's lit)
I get those goosebumps every time, yeah

When I text a cute game, wildness

Never Snapchat or took molly
She fall through plenty, her and all her ginnies, yeah
We at the top floor, right there off Doheny, yeah
Oh no, I can't fuck with y'all
Yeah, when I'm with my squad I cannot do no wrong
Yeah, saucin' in the city, don't get misinformed
Yeah, they gon' pull up on you (Brr, brr, brr)
Yeah, we gon' do some things, some things you can't relate
Yeah, 'cause we from a place, a place you cannot stay
Oh, you can't go, oh, I don't know
Oh, back the fuck up off me

[Chorus]
I get those goosebumps every time, yeah, you come around, yeah
You ease my mind, you make everything feel fine
Worried 'bout those comments
I'm way too numb, yeah, it's way too dumb, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time, I need the Heimlich
Throw that to the side, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time, yeah
When you're not around
When you throw that to the side, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time15Embed
