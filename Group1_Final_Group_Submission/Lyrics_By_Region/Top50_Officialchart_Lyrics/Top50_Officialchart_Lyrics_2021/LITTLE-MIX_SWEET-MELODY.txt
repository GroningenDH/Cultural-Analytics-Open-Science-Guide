Doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-roo-doo-doo, doo-roo-doo-roo
Doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-roo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo

[Verse 1: Jade]
In a whole 'nother life, there was this boy that I knew
He made me feel like a woman, we were young and silly fools
Anyway, he was in a band, wrote love songs about me
I wasn't crazy 'bout the words, but the melodies were sweet
Went something like

[Refrain: Jesy]
Doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-roo-doo-doo, doo-roo-doo-roo
Doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-roo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo

[Verse 2: Jesy, Leigh-Anne & Jesy, Leigh-Anne]
Every time we'd go dancing, I'd see his straying eyes
Gave him too many chances, pushed my keys too many times
Anyway, he'd start actin' up, and I'd be on my way to leave
But I stopped in my tracks when I heard this melody
And it went like
You might also like[Refrain: Leigh-Anne, Leigh-Anne & Jade]
Doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-roo-doo-doo, doo-roo-doo-roo
Doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-roo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo

[Chorus: All]
He used to sing me sweet melodies
He played me, made me believe it was real love
Sang me sweet melodies
But the day he did me wrong
The song couldn't go on and on and on
He used to sing me sweet melodies
He played me, made me believe it was real love
Sang me sweet melodies
But the day he did me wrong
The song couldn't go on and on and on

[Verse 3: Perrie, Perrie & Leigh-Anne, Perrie & Jesy]
He would lie, he would cheat, over syncopated beats
I was just his tiny dancer, he had control of my feet
Yes, when he came along, that's when I lost a groove
There was no song in the world to sing along or make me move
Sounded something like

[Refrain: Jesy, Leigh-Anne, Perrie]
Doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo (Ooh)
Doo-roo-doo-doo, doo-roo-doo-roo (It was)
Doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo (Ooh)
Doo-roo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo (Oh)
[Chorus: All, Perrie, Jade, Jesy]
He used to sing me sweet melodies (Oh, woah)
He played me, made me believe it was real love
Sang me sweet melodies
But the day he did me wrong (Ah, yeah)
The song couldn't go on and on and on (Couldn't go on, no)
He used to sing me sweet melodies (Sweet, sweet melodies)
He played me, made me believe it was real love (Real love)
Sang me sweet melodies
But the day he did me wrong (Me wrong)
The song couldn't go on and on and on (On and on and on)

[Post-Chorus: Jesy, Leigh-Anne, Jade, Perrie]
Doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo (Ooh; Ayy, ayy)
Doo-roo-doo-doo, doo-roo-doo-roo (Oh)
Doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo (Ooh)
Doo-roo-doo-doo, doo-roo-doo-roo (Oh, woah)

[Bridge: All, Jade, Leigh-Anne]
On and on (Oh-oh-oh)
On and on (Oh-oh-oh)
He used to sing me sweet melodies (Oh-oh-oh)
He played me, made me believe it was real love (Oh-oh-oh)
Sang me sweet melodies (Oh-oh-oh)
But the day he did me wrong (Me wrong)
The song couldn't go on and on and on
On and on and on, yeah
