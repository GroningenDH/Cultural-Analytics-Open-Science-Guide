BED (KREAM Remix) Lyrics[Verse 1]
9:05 in the evening
I'm all up in my feelings
I'm calling your phone 'cause I can't get enough
And I got work in the morning
Early, early in the morning
But who needs sleep when we're loving it up?

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, and why'd I gotta do this the hard way?
My body wants to be in your arms, bae, baby
Something I'll regret in the morning
But I just can't resist when you're calling

[Chorus]
I got a bed, but I'd rather be in yours tonight
I got a bed, but I'd rather be in yours (yours, yours)
That's what I said when I called you on the phone tonight
I got a bed, but I'd rather be in yours

[Post-Chorus]
But I'd rather be in yours (yours)
But I'd rather be in yours
But I'd rather be in yours (yours)
But I'd rather be in yours (yours)

You know I sleep on the left side
If you sleep on the left side
I'll move to the right, yeah, I'd do it for you
And I got work in the morning
Early, early in the morning
But who needs sleep when I'm rockin' with you?

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, and why'd I gotta do this the hard way?
My body wants to be in your arms, bae, baby
Something I'll regret in the morning
But I just can't resist when you're calling

[Chorus]
I got a bed, but I'd rather be in yours tonight
I got a bed, but I'd rather be in yours (yours, yours)
That's what I said when I called you on the phone tonight
I got a bed, but I'd rather be in yours
Rather be in yours

[Post-Chorus]
But I'd rather be in yours
But I'd rather be in yours

[Outro]
Too long on the phone right now
What you saying? Wanna roll right now
If you don't wanna be on your own right now
Ring my phone 'cause
I got a bed, but I'd rather be in yours tonightEmbed
