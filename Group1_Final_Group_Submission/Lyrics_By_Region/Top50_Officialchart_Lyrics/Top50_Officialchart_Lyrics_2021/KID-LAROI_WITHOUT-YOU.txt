You cut out a piece of me and now I bleed internally
Left here without you (No, no, no), without you (Ooh)
And it hurts for me to think about what life could possibly be like
Without you (No, no, no), without you (No, no)

[Verse]
I can't believe that you would up and leave me
Fuck all of your reasons
I lost my shit, you know I didn't mean it
Now I see it, you run and repeat it
And I can't take it back, so in the past is where we'll leave it, huh

[Pre-Chorus]
So there you go, oh
Can't make a wife out of a ho, oh
I'll never find the words to say I'm sorry
But I'm scared to be alone

[Chorus]
You cut out a piece of me and now I bleed internally
Left here without you (No, no, no), without you (Ooh)
And it hurts for me to think about what life could possibly be like
Without you (No, no, no), without you (No, no)

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh, woah, oh-oh, woah
Oh-oh, woah, oh-oh, woah
Without you, without you
Oh-oh, woah, oh-oh, woah
Oh-oh, woah, oh-oh, woah
Without you, without you

It's gon' be hard here on my own
And even harder to let you go
I really wish that we, could have got this right

[Pre-Chorus]
So here I go, oh
Can't make a wife out of a ho, oh
I'll never find the words to say I'm sorry
But I'm scared to be alone (Oh)

[Chorus]
You cut out a piece of me and now I bleed internally
Left here without you (No, no, no), without you (Ooh)
And it hurts for me to think about what life could possibly be like
Without you (No, no, no), without you (No, no)

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh, woah, oh-oh, woah
Oh-oh, woah, oh-oh, woah
Without you, without you (No, no, no)113Embed
