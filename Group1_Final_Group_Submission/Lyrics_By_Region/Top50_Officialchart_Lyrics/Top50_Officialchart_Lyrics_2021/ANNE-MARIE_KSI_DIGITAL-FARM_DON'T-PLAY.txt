Don’t Play Lyrics[Chorus: Anne-Marie]
Don't play games
Don't play games with my heart, ooh-wee
Now the feels hit me differently
When they hittin' this deep, don't play
Don't play, yeah, yeah
Don't play games
Don't play games with my heart, ooh-wee
Now the feels hit me differently
When they hittin' this deep, don't play
Don't play, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: KSI]
All that time on your own with me
We had fun on the 360
I helped you get a UAV
Still could never get you that AC
Sneakin' in school just to get by you
I'm obsessed with the scent on you
Coco Chanel on your neck with your body in check
Lovin' all the timе with you

[Pre-Chorus: KSI]
But now you've just gone missin'
You're airin' all my wishеs
You're online, but still won't listen
My time is you dismissin'
This is in no way a two-way street
I'm playin' "SAD!" and it's on repeat
Got me here hopin' you see my Snap
'Cause I'm not ready for us to wrap, no, woah

Don't play games
Don't play games with my heart, ooh-wee
Now the feels hit me differently
When they hittin' this deep, don't play
Don't play, yeah, yeah
Don't play games (Don't play games)
Don't play games with my heart, ooh-wee (With my heart)
Now the feels hit me differently (Differently, differently)
When they hittin' this deep, don't play (Don't play)
Don't play, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Anne-Marie]
All the things you doin'
Yeah, I think I've seen it all before
Seen it, seen it all before, ah
Everything you're sayin'
Yeah, I think I've heard it all before
Yeah, heard it all before
If you don't give me your time
Then I ain't givin' you mine, huh
If you're gonna lie
Then I'ma say goodbye
Every game you're playin'
Yeah, boy, I've played them all before
And I win them all
[Pre-Chorus: KSI, with Anne-Marie]
'Cause now you've just gone missin'
You're airin' all my wishes
You're online, but still won't listen
My time is you dismissin'
This is in no way a two-way street
I'm playin' "SAD!" and it's on repeat
Got me here hopin' you see my Snap
'Cause I'm not ready for us to wrap, no, woah

[Chorus: Anne-Marie]
Don't play games
Don't play games with my heart, ooh-wee
Now the feels hit me differently
When they hittin' this deep, don't play
Don't play, yeah, yeah (Oh, yeah, yeah)
Don't play games (Don't play games)
Don't play games with my heart, ooh-wee
Now the feels hit me differently (Differently)
When they hittin' this deep, don't play (Yeah, yeah)
Don't play, yeah, yeah
