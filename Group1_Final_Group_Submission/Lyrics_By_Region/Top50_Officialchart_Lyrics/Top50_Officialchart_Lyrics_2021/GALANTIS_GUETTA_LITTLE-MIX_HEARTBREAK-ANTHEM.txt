Hello, it's me, your ex
I called to say not sorry, but I wish you the best
And I don't hold no grudges, promise this ain't a test
We okay, we okay

[Pre-Chorus: Leigh-Anne]
Sometimes it works out, but sometimes it don't
Maybe we'll fix this or maybe we won't
Sometimes a heart can sink like a stone
Until you find home

[Chorus: Perrie, All]
This ain't a heartbreak anthem
I don't care what happened
But I ain't got no time to dwell on it
Don't wanna throw a tantrum
You did what you had to
No, I ain't got no time to dwell on it
And I don't wanna feel, I don't wanna feel hollow
Chasin' you and me, chasin' all of these shadows
This ain't a heartbreak anthem
I don't care what happened
But I ain't got no time to dwell on it

[Post-Chorus: All, Perrie]
This ain't a heartbreak anthem (Ooh-ooh)
This ain't a heartbreak, this ain't a heartbreak
This ain't a heartbreak anthem
No heartbreak anthem, no heartbreak anthem
(Ain't a heartbreak)

And thanks to you I'm wearing out this bulletproof vest
But I'll be okay (Okay), I'm okay (I'm okay)

[Pre-Chorus: Leigh-Anne, Perrie]
Sometimes it works out, but sometimes it don't (Sometimes it don't)
Maybe we'll fix this or maybe we won't
Sometimes a heart can sink like a stone
Until you find home

[Chorus: Perrie, Leigh-Anne, Jade, All]

I don't care what happened
But I ain't got no time to dwell on it (Time to dwell on it, oh)
Don't wanna throw a tantrum (Ah)

I don't care what happened
But I ain't got no time to dwell on it (To dwell on it)

[Post-Chorus: All, Perrie, Jade]

This ain't a heartbreak, this ain't a heartbreak
This ain't a heartbreak anthem
No heartbreak anthem, no heartbreak anthem
(Ain't a heartbreak; No, ooh)

This ain't a heartbreak anthem (This ain't, oh)
I don't care what happened
But I ain't got no time to dwell on it33Embed
