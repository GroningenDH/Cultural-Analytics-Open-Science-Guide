Black Magic Lyrics[Verse 1]
Driving down the four-five
Running all the stop signs
The way you're touching my skin
The way you're making me sin
Laying in your back seat
So put your magic on me
Come on tie me up in your strings (uh)
Make me do anything

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, got me looking hella crazy
Yeah, yeah, got me tripping on you lately
Yeah, yeah, I'm under your spell and I'm under your body
Oh-ohh

[Chorus]
It's like black, black magic
You work your voodoo on me
Black, black magic, the things you do to me, yeah
Black, black magic, oh, just like that
Black, black magic, you work your voodoo on me
Black, black magic, you work your voodoo on me
Black, black magic, the things you do to me, yeah
Black, black magic, oh just like that
Black, black magic, you work your voodoo on me

Black, black (on me)
Black, black (on me)
Black, black (on me)
Black, black
Black, black (on me)
Black (oh, just like that)
Black black (on me)
Black black

[Verse 2]
Staring in your dark eyes
You're controlling my mind
The way you're touching my skin
The way you're making me sin
Praying down on my knees
So the devil doesn't take me
Tangled up in emotions
We go down in slow motion

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, got me looking hella crazy
Yeah, yeah, got me tripping on you lately
Yeah, yeah, I'm under your spell and I'm under your body
Oh-ohh
[Chorus]
It's like black, black magic
You work your voodoo on me
Black, black magic, the things you do to me, yeah
Black, black magic, oh, just like that
Black, black magic, you work your voodoo on me
Black, black magic, you work your voodoo on me
Black, black magic, the things you do to me yeah
Black, black magic, oh, just like that
Black, black magic, you work your voodoo on me

[Post-Chorus]
Black, black (on me)
Black, black (on me)
Black, black
Black, black (on me)
Black, black (on me)
Black, black (black, black magic)
Black, black (on me)
Black, black
Black, black magic
Black, black magic
Black, black magic, oh, just like that
