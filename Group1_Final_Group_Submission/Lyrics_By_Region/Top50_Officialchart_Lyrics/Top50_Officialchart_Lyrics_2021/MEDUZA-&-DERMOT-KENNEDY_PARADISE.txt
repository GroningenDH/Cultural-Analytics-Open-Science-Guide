TranslationsDeutschParadise Lyrics[Intro]
Mm, mm
Mm, mm-mm-mm

[Verse 1]
In the fading light, hearts collide
Shadows dance in the distance
Something just ain't right, I'm cold inside
Help me find what I'm missin'

[Pre-Chorus]
We're all scared to fly, still we try
Learn to be brave, see the other side
Won't you lead me there? Have no fear
Close your eyes, find paradise

[Chorus]
Oh, my, my, my
There's a thousand miles between you and I
Oh, my, my, my (My, my, my)
Just a thousand miles between me and paradise
Oh, my, my, my (My, my, my)
There's a thousand miles between you and I
Oh, my, my, my (My, my, my)
Just a thousand miles between me and paradise

Oh, paradise
Oh, my, my, my
Oh, paradise
Oh, my, my, my
Oh, paradise
Oh, my, my, my
Just a thousand miles between me and paradise

[Verse 2]
When the dark has gone, the morning's won
We're gonna feel something different
It will set you free, if you just tell me
Every secret, I'll listen

[Pre-Chorus]
We're all scared to fly, still we try
Learn to be brave, see the other side
Won't you lead me there? Have no fear
Close your eyes, find paradise
Paradise, paradise
Close your eyes, find paradise
Paradise, paradise
Close your eyes, find para-

[Chorus]
Oh, my, my, my
There's a thousand miles between you and I
Oh, my, my, my (My, my, my)
Just a thousand miles between me and paradise
[Post-Chorus]
Oh, ah, oh, my, my, my
Oh, ah, oh, my, my, my
Oh, ah, oh, my, my, my
Just a thousand miles between me and paradise8Embed
