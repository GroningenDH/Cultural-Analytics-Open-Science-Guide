Higher Love Lyrics[Intro]
Bring me higher love, love
Bring me higher love

[Verse 1]
Think about it, there must be a higher love
Down in the heart or hidden in the stars above
Without it, life is wasted time
Look inside your heart, and I'll look inside mine

[Pre-Chorus]
Things look so bad everywhere
In this whole world, what is fair?
We walk the line and try to see
Falling behind in what could be, oh

[Chorus]
Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love, oh
Bring me a higher love
Where's that higher love I keep thinking of?

[Post-Chorus]
Bring me higher love, love
Bring me higher love (Oh)
Bring me higher love, love
Bring me a higher love
Bring me higher love, love
Bring me higher love (Oh)
Bring me higher love, love
Bring me a higher love

Worlds are turning, and we're just hanging on
Facing our fear, and standing out there alone
A yearning, yeah, and it's real to me
There must be someone who's feeling for me

[Pre-Chorus]
Things look so bad everywhere
In this whole world, what is fair?
We walk the line and try to see
Falling behind in what could be, oh

[Chorus]
Bring me a higher love (My love)
Bring me a higher love, oh (Oh)
Bring me a higher love (My love)
Where's that higher love I keep thinking of?

[Post-Chorus]
Bring me higher love, love
Bring me higher love (Oh)
Bring me higher love, love
Bring me a higher love

[Chorus]
Bring me a higher love (Oh, bring me love)
Bring me a higher love, oh (We need a higher love)
Bring me a higher love (Bring me, bring me, yeah)
A higher love I keep thinking of, oh
[Post-Chorus]
(Bring me a higher love)
Bring me higher love, love
(Bring me a higher love)
Bring me higher love (Oh)
(Bring me a higher love)
Bring me higher love, love
A higher love I keep thinking of, oh

[Outro]
Bring me a higher love
(Bring me higher love, love)
Bring me a higher love, oh
(Bring me higher love)9Embed
