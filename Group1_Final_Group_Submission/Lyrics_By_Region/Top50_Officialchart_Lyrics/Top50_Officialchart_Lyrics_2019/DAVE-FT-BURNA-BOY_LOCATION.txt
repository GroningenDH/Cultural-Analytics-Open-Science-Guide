Location Lyrics[Intro]
JAE5

[Chorus: Burna Boy]
If you send me the location
Then I'll be right there
And make I come check you, my baby
No time, no
And my dawg is on probation
Another 5 years
Me bring girls to his location
No time, no

[Verse 1: Dave]
Send me the location
This year ’bout vacations
Flight catching, train taking
Soon as my nigga off probation
Your boyfriend's on a waiting ting
Looking for one wish, on a Ray J ting
I pree'd that girl, outrageous ting
But she can’t see 'cause I got shades and ting
Bare girls wanna throw shade and ting
No shade, what shade is your foundation in?
Darkest grey, the shade I'm in
49 more if your babes wants in
I had me a famous ting
Goals and tings, gains and tings
My house party a babe station
Girls wanna chase, it's a status ting

If you send me the location
Then I'll be right there
And make I come check you, my baby
No time, no
And my dawg is on probation
Another 5 years
Me bring girls to his location
No time, no

[Verse 2: Dave]
Look, playboy, I don't need a Carti
I'm captain, I lead the army
Bad ratio, I leave the party
Three Somalis creepin' on me
Your ex wavy, we tsunami
Girl from India, sweet as naani
Head so good, now I speak Gujarati
You hardly, pardon me, I’m laughing again
I assisted, man, passed to my friend
Look, money like the alphabet
If you wanna see P’s, gotta pass on the ends
Came a long way from a park in the bends
To an '18 plate, man’s parking a Benz
Far from the rest but I'm far from my best
Life is a lesson, I'm passing a test
Yes, everyting blessed
I don't want drama and I don’t want stress
My girl got finesse, Caribbean flex
Body and chest, take buddy in chest
Thank God more, I grew up with less
Juss to the right, Rapz to the left
Rj in the middle, got Cee to the death
Batch full of dogs with the 60's vets
[Chorus: Burna Boy]
If you send me the location
Then I'll be right there
And make I come check you, my baby
No time, no
And my dawg is on probation
Another 5 years
Me bring girls to his location

[Refrain: Burna Boy]
Nigga I was down but I made it to the top right now
(Right now, right now, right now)
And I can pull a couple grand out my pocket right now
(Right now, right now, right now)
Yeah I'm so fly, yeah I'm flyer than a rocket right now
(Right now, right now, right now)
And all the games you play never stop right now
(Right now, right now, right now)

[Verse 3: Burna Boy]
I pull up on the block, I see everybody watching
'Cause there's diamonds on my chain
And there's diamonds on my watch
Money moves, Off-White shoes
Came straight from Virgil Abloh
I've been down, I've been low
Had my mattress on the floor
No map, North Cap, bend it up
Gyal a ring-ring my cellular
Mi 'ave big fat spliff pon me, nuh
Inna the big black Benz, pullin' up
Please tell everybody to start pulling up
'Nough champagne from the bar coming up
Party hard, make her live my life, oh
[Refrain: Burna Boy]
Nigga I was down but I made it to the top right now
(Right now, right now, right now)
And I can pull a couple grand out my pocket right now
(Right now, right now, right now)
Yeah I'm so fly, yeah I'm flyer than a rocket right now
(Right now, right now, right now)
And all the games you play never stop right now
(Right now, right now, right now)

[Chorus: Burna Boy]
If you send me the location
Then I'll be right there
And make I come check you, my baby
No time, no
And my dawg is on probation
Another 5 years
Me bring girls to his location
No time, no18Embed
