Wish You Well Lyrics[Verse 1]
It's sad we're not together, but I wish happiness for you
I know we said forever, love don't always make it through

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes, even the good things get lost along the way
We opened up the same book, we found a different page
'Cause honestly, your loyalties, insecurities
And priorities ain't the same
The harmony, it's the only thing I can save

[Chorus]
I wish you well, I wish you well (I wish you well, I wish you well)
I wish you well, I wish you well (I wish you well, I wish you well)
'Cause honestly your loyalties, insecurities
And priorities ain't the same
The harmony, it's the only thing I can save
I wish you well, I wish you well
(I wish you, I wish you, I wish you)
I wish you well
I wish you well

[Verse 2]
I hope that you remember, that I was always good to you
And even though you hurt me, ah, I just had to see it through
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes, even the good things get lost along the way
I had to let you go, but I wanted you to stay
'Cause honestly, your loyalties, insecurities
And priorities ain't the same
The harmony, it's the only thing I can save

[Chorus]
I wish you well, I wish you well (I wish you well, I wish you well)
I wish you well, I wish you well
'Cause honestly, your loyalties, insecurities
And priorities ain't the same
The harmony, it's the only thing I can save
I wish you well, I wish you well
(I wish you, I wish you, I wish you, I wish you well)

[Bridge]
Wish you well, I wish you well, I
Wish you well, I wish you well, I
Wish you well, I wish you well, I
Wish you well, I

[Chorus]
I wish you well
I wish you well, oh oh
I wish, I wish (I wish you well)
(I wish you, I wish you, I wish you well)14Embed
