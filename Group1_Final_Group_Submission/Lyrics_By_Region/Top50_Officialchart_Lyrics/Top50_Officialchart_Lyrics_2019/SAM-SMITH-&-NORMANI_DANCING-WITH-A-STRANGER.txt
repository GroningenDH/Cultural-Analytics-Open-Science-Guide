Hmm, mhm

[Verse 1: Sam Smith]
I don't wanna be alone tonight (Alone tonight)
It's pretty clear that I'm not over you (Over you, over you)
I'm still thinking 'bout the things you do (Things you do)
So I don't wanna be alone tonight, alone tonight, alone tonight
Can you light the fire? (Light the fire, light the fire)
I need somebody who can take control (Take control)
I know exactly what I need to do
'Cause I don't wanna be alone tonight, alone tonight, alone tonight

[Chorus: Sam Smith]
Look what you made me do, I'm with somebody new
Ooh, baby, baby, I'm dancing with a stranger
Look what you made me do, I'm with somebody new
Ooh, baby, baby, I'm dancing with a stranger
Dancing with a stranger

[Verse 2: Normani]
I wasn't even going out tonight (Out tonight)
But, boy, I need to get you off of my mind (Off of my mind)
I know exactly what I have to do
I don't wanna be alone tonight, alone tonight, alone tonight
