Toddla T produc-y

[Hook: Bugsey]
Strike me a pose, girl you're kinda cute yah know
Here all alone, girl you gotta loosen up
'Cause your body wanna move yah know
Uptight, just loosen up
MacDaddy with the juice yah know
Sippin' on a Duck-Duck-Goose yah know
Strike me a pose, girl you're kinda cute yah know
Here all alone, girl you gotta loosen up
'Cause your body wanna move yah know
Uptight, just loosen up
MacDaddy with the juice yah know
Sippin' on a Duck-Duck-Goose yah know

[Verse 1: Bugsey and Young T]
Ayy, ayy
Look into my eyes, tell me what do you see?
I see wrist bust-down nigga, twenty on each
That's a big back baby come and fling it on me
Rosé by the case when I Bon Appétit
Watch your girl, 'cah she digging the drip
If she with me then she ain't a regular bitch
Rock my world, she a freak, Little Mix
We got a freezer in the Range shorty come take a sip
Gucci on her hip with the Fashionova thick
Can you do a trick? Can you do it on a dick?
That's a big fat couple racks spend it on a coat
Hit me on a low, I got money that I'm tryna blow
Money that I'm tryna throw, six figures on a deal-y
Feel like Biggaveli now I got a lil Kimmy
Yo feel like Makaveli when I pull up in the city
Buss' a dance for me, I ain't talkin' 'bout The Shiggy

Strike me a pose, girl you're kinda cute yah know
Here all alone, girl you gotta loosen up
'Cause your body wanna move yah know

Sippin' on a Duck-Duck-Goose yah know
Strike me a pose, girl you're kinda cute yah know
Here all alone, girl you gotta loosen up
'Cause your body wanna move yah know
Uptight, just loosen up
MacDaddy with the juice yanna
Sippin' on a Duck-Duck-Goose yah know

[Verse 2: Aitch]
Young Aitch fly boy, a MacDaddy with the juice
Strike a pose babygirl, you lookin' sassy for the shoot
Came from Nottingham to Manny with a baddie in the coupe
I'm 19 she's 32, to her I'm actually a yute (hehehe)
Heh, wrap another zoot
Tell her turn around, show me what the back of it can do
Loosen up, shake it off, back it up a few
Them other girls are too jealous, they ain't flashier than you (no way)
Bend it over, push it on me then rotate your hips (woo!)
When we fucked she let me take a pic
One chance, are you leaving or are you taking it?
I got some white chocolate, I promise you'll like the taste of it
Blitzed a couple bottles now I'm zoned out
Mandem moving mad, more time they're getting thrown out
Hold that position, quick let me get my phone out
Babe just do me a favour and---
[Hook: Bugsey]
Strike me a pose, girl you're kinda cute yah know
Here all alone, girl you gotta loosen up
'Cause your body wanna move yah know
Uptight, just loosen up
MacDaddy with the juice yah know
Sippin' on a Duck-Duck-Goose yah know
Strike me a pose, girl you're kinda cute yah know
Here all alone, girl you gotta loosen up
'Cause your body wanna move yah know
Uptight, just loosen up
MacDaddy with the juice yah know
Sippin' on a Duck-Duck-Goose yah know
