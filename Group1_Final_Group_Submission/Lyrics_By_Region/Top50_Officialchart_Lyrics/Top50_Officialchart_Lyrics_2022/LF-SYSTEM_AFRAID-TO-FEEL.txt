Afraid To Feel Lyrics[Intro]
Oh, you see the flames of burnin' passion
When I look in your eyes, yes, yes, oh, yes
Are you afraid to feel what you know is real, ah
Like any other guy?

[Chorus]
Oh, playin' on—, the flames of burnin' passion
When I look in your eyes, yes, yes, oh, yes
Are you afraid to feel what you know is real, ah
Like any other guy?
I know you see the flames of burnin' passion
When I look in your eyes, yes, yes, oh, yes
Are you afraid to feel what you know is real, ah
Like any other guy?
Oh, playin' on my heart will get you nothing
You got to come on inside
My heart's an open door, who could ask for more?
Come on in for a ride

[Post-Chorus]
Can't stop (Can't stop)
What I'm doin' (What I'm doin'), what I'm doin' to you
Can't stop
Turnin' you on
