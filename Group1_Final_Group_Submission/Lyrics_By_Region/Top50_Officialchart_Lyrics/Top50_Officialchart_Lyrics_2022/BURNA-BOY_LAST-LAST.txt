Last Last Lyrics[Intro]
E don cast, last last, na everybody go chop breakfast
Shayo
Shayo
Igbo

[Verse 1]
You go bow for the result o
Nothing to discuss o, cause I dey win by default
And without any doubt o
Omo me I be adult o, I no go fit take your— (I no go fit take your insult o)
Omo mind as you dey talk o
I put my life into my job
And I know I'm in trouble
She manipulate my love o
I no holy and I no denge pose like Baba Fryo
My eye o don cry o

[Chorus]
I need Igbo and shayo (Shayo)

Shayo (Shayo) shayo (shayo)
I need Igbo and shayo (Shayo)
I need Igbo and shayo (Shayo)

I dey Port Harcourt when dem kill Soboma
I dey try to buy motor one Toyota Corolla
My feelings been dey swing like jangolova
Feelings been dey swing like jangolova
Now you crash your Ferrari for Lekki, Burna
Na small thing remain, it could have been all over
My feelings still dey swing like jangolova
Feelings still dey swing like-
Ti n ba ni kе juru, e juru
Omo why to’o ki nfe ni suru?
Why you say I did nothing for you
When I for do anything you want mе to do
Ti n ba ni ke juru, e juru (E juru)
Omo why to'o ki nfe ni suru? (Ni suru)
Why you say I did nothing for you
When I for do anything you want me to do
Maybe another time, maybe another life you will be my wife and we'll get it right
E don cast, last last, na everybody go chop breakfast
Have to say bye bye o, bye bye o to the love of my life
My eye o don cry o

[Chorus]
