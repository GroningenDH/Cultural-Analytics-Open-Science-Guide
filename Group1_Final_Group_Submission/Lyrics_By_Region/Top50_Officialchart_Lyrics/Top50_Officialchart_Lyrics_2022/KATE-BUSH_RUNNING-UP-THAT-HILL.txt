Running Up That Hill (Kate Bush cover) Lyrics[Verse 1]
It doesn't hurt me
You want to feel how it feels
You want to know, know that it doesn't hurt me
You want to hear about the deal that I'm making

[Pre-Chorus]
You
You and me

[Chorus]
And if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
I'd get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
Be running up that building
If I only could, oh...

[Verse 2]
You don't want to hurt me
But see how deep the bullet lies
Unaware I'm tearing you asunder
Ooh, there is thunder in our hearts, baby
Is there so much hate for the ones we love?
Tell me, we both matter, don't we?
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
You
You and me, won't be unhappy

[Chorus]
And if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
I'd get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
Be running up that building
If I only could, oh...

[Bridge]
Come on, baby
Come on, come on, darling
Let me steal this moment from you now
Come on, angel
Come on, come on, darling
Let's exchange the experience, oh

[Chorus]
And if I only could
Make a deal with God
I'd get him to swap our places
I'd be running up that road
Be running up that hill
Be running up that building
If I only could, oh
If i only could, ohEmbed
