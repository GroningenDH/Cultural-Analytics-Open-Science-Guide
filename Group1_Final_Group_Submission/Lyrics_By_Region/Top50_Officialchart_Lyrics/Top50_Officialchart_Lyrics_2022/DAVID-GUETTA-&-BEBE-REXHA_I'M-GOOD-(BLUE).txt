Baby, I'ma have the best fuckin' night of my life
And wherever it takes me, I'm down for the ride
Baby, don't you know I'm good, yeah, I'm feelin' alright

Baby, I'ma have the best fuckin' night of my life
And wherever it takes me, I'm down for the ride

[Verse]
You know I'm down for whatever tonight
I don't need the finer things in life
No matter where I go, it's a good time, yeah

Middle of the floor, that's where I'll be
Don't got a lot, but that's enough for me, yeah
