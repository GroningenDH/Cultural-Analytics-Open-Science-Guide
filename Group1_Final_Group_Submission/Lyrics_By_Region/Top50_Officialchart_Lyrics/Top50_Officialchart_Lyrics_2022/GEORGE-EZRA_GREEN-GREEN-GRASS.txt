(Throw a party)
(Throw a party, yeah)
(Throw a party)

[Verse 1]
Well, she moves like lightning
And she counts to three
And she turns out all the lights
And says she's coming for me
Now put your hands up, this is a heist
And there's no one in here living
Gonna make it out alive

[Pre-Chorus]
Loaded up when the sun comes down
Getaway car for two young lovers
Me and the girl straight out of town
Over the hills and undercover
Undercover
Undercover

[Chorus]
She said
Green, green grass
Blue, blue sky
You better throw a party on the day that I die
Green, green grass
Blue, bluе sky
You better throw a party on the day that I diе

But the girl is so much more than just another apple thief
Yeah, she's a genius (Genius), watch and learn
How she sets the world on fire
Just to watch the sucker burn

[Pre-Chorus]
Loaded up when the sun comes down
Getaway car for two young lovers
Me and the girl straight out of town
Over the hills and undercover
Undercover
Undercover

[Chorus]
She said
Green, green grass
Blue, blue sky
You better throw a party on the day that I die
Green, green grass
Blue, blue sky
You better throw a party on the day that I die
