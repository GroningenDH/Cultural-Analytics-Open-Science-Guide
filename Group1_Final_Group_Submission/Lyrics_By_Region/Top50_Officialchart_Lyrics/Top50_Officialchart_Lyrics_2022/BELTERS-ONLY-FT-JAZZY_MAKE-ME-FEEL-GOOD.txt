Make Me Feel Good Lyrics[Verse 1]
I was in the club
Somewhere near the bar
I was in the club
Somewhere near the bar, when I
Saw that man, ooh
I was in the club
Somewhere near the bar, when I
Saw that man, yeah
There was no place for him in my arms, so I
Walked over to him
And I laid down my charm
"What's a man like you doing in a place like this?"
He said, "Would you like to dance?"
Fulfil my wish

[Chorus]
Make me feel good (good)
Make me feel nice (nice)
Give me your loving all through the night
Make mе feel good (good)
Make me feel nice (ooh)
Givе me your loving all through the night
Make me feel good (good)
Make me feel nice (nice)
Give me your loving all through the night

Ooh, what you did to me
One touch from his hand
