(Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
(Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
(Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
(Ooh)

[Verse 1]
You want the girl with the small waist
And the perfect smile
Someone who's out every weekday
In her dad's new car
You tell me I shouldn't stress out
Say, "It's not that hard"
But I just got a feeling
This will leave an ugly scar

[Pre-Chorus]
If you say, "She's nothing to worry about"
Then why'd you close your eyes when you said it out loud?

[Chorus]
Stupid boy making me so sad
Didn't think you could change this fast
She's got everything that I don't have
How could I ever compete with that?
I know you'll go and change your mind
One day wake up and be bored with mine
She's got everything that I don't havе
And she's all I wanna be, all I wanna be so bad, so bad
Shе's got everything that I don't have, hm-mm

You want someone you can show off
Whenever you go out
She'll wear a tight mini black dress
With all her friends around
And then you'll probably spend the night at
Her nice big house
And by then I'll just be someone
You've forgotten about, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
If you say, "She's nothing to worry about"
Then why'd you close your eyes when you said it out loud?

[Chorus]
Stupid boy making me so sad
Didn't think you could change this fast
She's got everything that I don't have
How could I ever compete with that?
I know you'll go and change your mind
One day wake up and be bored with mine
She's got everything that I don't have
And she's all I wanna be, all I wanna be so bad, so bad
She's got everything that I don't have
And she's all I wanna be, all I wanna be
[Post-Chorus]
She's all I wanna be so bad, oh-ooh

[Chorus]
Stupid boy making me so sad
Didn't think you would hurt this bad
She's got everything that I don't have
How could I ever compete with that?
I know you'll go and change your mind
One day wake up and be bored with mine
She's got everything that I don't have
And she's all I wanna be, all I wanna be so bad
All I wanna be so bad (So bad)
She's got everything that I don't have (So bad)
And she's all I wanna be, all I wanna be so bad18Embed
