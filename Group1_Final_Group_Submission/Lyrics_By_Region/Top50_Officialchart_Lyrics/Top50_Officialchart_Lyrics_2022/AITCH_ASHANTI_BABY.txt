Baby Lyrics[Intro: Aitch & Ashanti]
Awww, baby, awww, baby
I just wanna love you, baby
Always thinkin' of you, baby
You know I got it, baby, what do you want? (Awww, baby)
You know I got it, baby, what do you need? (Awww, baby)

[Verse 1: Aitch & Ashanti]
Yeah, yo, I don't only love her for the sex (Awww, baby)
But I swear to God, I love it when she says (Awww, baby)
She know that she fuckin' with the best
Thinkin' she an angel 'til I put her on the bed (Ha)
Gotta chase this money, baby, nothin' to be said (Awww, baby)
I ain't having no distraction when I'm runnin' up a cheque (Awww, baby)
Every time I leave the crib, I got you lookin' at me stressed
But as soon as I'm home (Oh, baby, I'm satisfied)
Yeah, face down, arse up, cock it right back
Baby, how you not a model with a body like that? (Awww, baby)
Oh God, when she top me, she the top of my class
When we fuck, I'ma copyright that (That's mine)
I be on a vibe
Money to the side, I'm just tryna live my life (Yeah)
I can't even leave without her giving me the eyes
Babe, it ain't my fault, I gotta focus on what's mine
Take it easy, give me time (Young Aitch, yeah)

[Verse 2: Aitch & Ashanti]
She want kids, I want cribs in the sticks (Yeah)
Still boujee, she ain't tryna wait 'til Christmas for gifts (Ooh)
If I left, would she miss me a bit? (Yeah)
Is she ridin' my wave? Is she sinkin' my ship? (No way)
Tough love, yeah, it literally is
And I know you get pissed when you're thinkin' of it (Uh)
But we can still get that bling on your wrist
She like, "Oh, baby, I'm satisfied" (Woo)
Yeah, yo, now I'm zoned out, start to go mental
I can't mix my love with my schedule (No way)
Always askin' me why I'm never home
I just said, "I gotta push my potential"
Wake up lookin' sexy, and she stunning when she pose
Close to perfect when she naked and she curvy in the clothes
Get the Lamborghini white, I paint the Urus like her toes
Ain't no other brother got her this certi and she knows (Young Aitch)

Can you rock with me? (Awww, baby)
Nonstop with me (Oh, no)
Can you take it to the top with me?
I just wanna love you, baby (I wanna love you, babe) (Hahaha)
Always thinking of you, babe (Thinkin' of you)
Can you roll with me? (Ooh, baby)
All over me (Over me)
Can you take control of me?

She say, "Always thinkin' of you, baby" (Yeah)
Can you roll with me? (Ooh, baby)
All over me (Over me)
Can you take control of me? (Yeah)

Always thinking of you, baby1Embed
