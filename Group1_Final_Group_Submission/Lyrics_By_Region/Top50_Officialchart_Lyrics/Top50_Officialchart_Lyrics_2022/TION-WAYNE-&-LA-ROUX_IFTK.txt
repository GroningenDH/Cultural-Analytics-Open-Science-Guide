IFTK Lyrics[Intro: La Roux & Tion Wayne]
I'm goin' in for the kill (Mm-mm)
(It's Tekky)
I'm doin' it for a thrill
Oh, I'm hopin' you'll understand
(WhYJay)
And not let go of my—
You better mind out, we'll still press on the 9 (Yo)

[Verse 1]
No privilege, but I had an option (Mm-mm)
To never be stuck up on the block then (Brap)
More money, more problems (Ayy)
We don't get along like Arsenal, Tottenham
Everybody wanna hate now, but fuck them
Gal from North London said I made it (Boom)
Big Russian must come in function (Brap, brap, brap)
Don't make a rich man haffa back it and aim it (Ayy)
Chop it and shave it (Ayy, ayy)
Haters nearly had a stroke from my savings
I was popped down, now they can't face it
Chased it, chased it until I just made it
Ooh (Ooh)
'Membеr when I couldn't buy food (Food)
Now my gal lookin' all smooth (Smooth)
Lambo' truck on the move (Brap, brap)
Should'vе rolled out in a coupe (Brap)
You might also like[Chorus: La Roux & Tion Wayne]
(I'm goin' in for the kill)
But all of these guys wan' take 'way my life (Grrt, grrt)
(I'm doin' it for a thrill)
But all of these gal wan' F with the 9 (Mm-mm)
(Oh, I'm hopin' you'll understand)
In my new ends, low percentage of crime (Boom)

[Verse 2]
Prada always treat me and my set (Mm-mm) like Gianfranco Zola (Grrt)
In N9, see me, I'm like Pep (Pep) G-Guardiola (Braow)
Even on streets, see me, was a soldier (Ayy)
Said they wanna be like me when he's older (Ayy, ayy)
All this crud that my knees went weak when I put Mama Wayne in a Rover (Boom)
You could never be like me, no
Made a quarter milly last week, shows (Mm-mm)
Of course I gotta keep the right team close
Why they wanna see me D-I-E? (Brap, brap, brap)
In the war, I ain't far from a beast (Aye, aye)
'Round here, we only run from police (Baow)
All these brothers all talk in the streets (Pussies)
But they say they involved in the beef
Tom Ford suit, now I'm feelin' all trendy
'Member when the wallet was empty (Money)
Cop these boots, feel Édouard Mendy
Real black brother in Chelsea (Grrt)
No talk, I state how I feel
I feel more hungry, makin' a mill'
I was so broke, couldn't pay for the bill (Brap)
Course I'm goin' in straight for the kill (Brap, brap, brap, brap)
[Chorus: La Roux & Tion Wayne]
(I'm goin' in for the kill)
But all of these guys wan' take 'way my life (Grrt, grrt)
(I'm doin' it for a thrill)
But all of these gal wan' F with the 9 (Mm-mm)
(Oh, I'm hopin' you'll understand)
In my new ends, low percentage of crime (Boom)
(And not let go of my—)
You better mind out, we'll still press on the 9 (Brap, brap, brap)
(I'm goin' in for the kill)
But all of these guys wan' take 'way my life (Grrt, grrt)
(I'm doin' it for a thrill)
But all of these gal wan' F with the 9 (Mm-mm)
(Oh, I'm hopin' you'll understand)
In my new ends, low percentage of crime (Boom)
(And not let go of my—)
You better mind out, we'll still press on the 9 (Brap, brap, brap)

[Verse 3]
Old times in the ends, we was just ridin' on them (Grah, grah, boom)
I looked the judge in the eye and I just lied for my friend (Buh)
I listen to these UK rappers and they're just lyin' again (You liar)
On my block, I got bare haters, but I got fire for them (Brap, brap)
When we was young bruck fellas, everybody was brothers (Mad)
They was cool 'til we made it, then everybody got jealous
But didn't get a dime from the block (Ayy)
Whether you like it or not (Ayy)
Mm-mm, grrt, grrt, brap
[Outro: La Roux & Tion Wayne]
I'm goin' in for the kill (Grrt, grrt)
I'm doin' it for a thrill (Mm-mm)
Oh, I'm hopin' you'll understand
And not let go of my— (Brap, brap, brap)
I'm goin' in for the kill (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
I'm doin' it for a thrill (Mm-mm)
Oh, I'm hopin' you'll understand (Boom)
And not let go of my—
(Brap)1Embed
