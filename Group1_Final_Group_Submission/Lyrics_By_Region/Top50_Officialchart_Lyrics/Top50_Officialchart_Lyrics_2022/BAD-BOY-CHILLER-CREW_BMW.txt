BMW Lyrics[Intro]
Yo she a diva not a keeper
Yo tell her come jump in the beemer
No I don't want to fight for no reason
Yo I gonna lie girl I feel ya
Yo she made me go so crazy
Yo she got my heartbeat racing
Yo why you wanna act fugazi
Yo you ain't nothing like these ladies

[Chorus]
Yo she a diva not a keeper
Yo tell her come jump in the beemer
No I don't want to fight for no reason
Yo I ain't gonna lie girl I feel ya
Yo she made me go so crazy
Yo she got my heartbeat racing
Yo why you wanna act fugazi
Yo you ain't nothin like these ladies

[Verse 1]
Misbehaving, get the champagne in
Raving, hit ya town n gеt wavey
Wasted, I love all sorts of ladiеs
She wanna fuck now your boy just made it
Crazy, I take shots till I'm faded
A list, I ain't yet but I'm nearly
Racing, I go nuts in Mercedes
Stages, I kick shots in my trainers
Blow that shit
Better blow that cloud
Better fill that cup till the sun goes down
Big boy Jeep imma spin that round
Five man deep gonna run man down
She thinks she been the one for me
Now it's MTV on her TV screen
Don't envy me I'm the MVP
On a spending spree, I got tendencies
You might also like[Chorus]
Yo she a diva not a keeper
Yo tell her come jump in the beemer
No I don't want to fight for no reason
Yo I gonna lie girl I feel ya
Yo she made me go so crazy
Yo she got my heartbeat racing
Yo why you wanna act fugazi
Yo you ain't nothing like these ladies

Yo you ain't nothing like these hoes
Yo you been living this life before
Yo I don't wanna to fight no more
Yo when I'm with the guys on tour
Yo I raise the roof when I step in
Hit casino get the bets in
We be D low when we texting
Yo she ain't no fool to be messed with

[Verse 2]
I'm in the club fucked, she don't wanna go yard
I got my funds up, I been tryna go hard
Got ma guns up everytime we roll out
Am all bunged up I ain't tryna slow down
Goose in ma rider, can't take a night off
Imma write off, someone tell me put the mic on
I'm an icon and I do what I want
She my wife now take her to the islands
[verse 3]
Girl I think that I'm in love with you
Jump in the back of this BMW
M sports seats make you feel comfortable
Those blue eyes make you look wonderful
Fuck these, your mine you ain't number 2
Lets fly out put blue seas under you
I make time when I got stuff to do
I like you girl do you like me too

[Chorus]
Yo she a diva not a keeper
Yo tell her come jump in the beemer
No I don't want to fight for no reason
Yo I gonna lie girl I feel ya
Yo she made me go so crazy
Yo she got my heartbeat racing
Yo why you wanna act fugazi
Yo you ain't nothing like these ladies

Yo you ain't nothing like these hoes
Yo you been living this life before
Yo I don't wanna to fight no more
Yo when I'm with the guys on tour
Yo I raise the roof when I step in
Hit casino get the bets in
We be D low when we texting
Yo she ain't no fool to be messed with
[Bridge]
She a Barbie girl, not a party girl
I ain't gonna lie if I pull up outside all eyes on her
She make me go so crazy, she got me lost for words
She don't wanna tell no lies
Good vibes when I ride with her
Am a different man, now the tables turned
Yo girl lets roll out
Imma fly round
Pick you up somewhere nice we can dine out
Hit the club get drunk we can while out
Good times good vibes good times what lifes bout
Jump in the beemer you're mine for the weekend
Yo we can live life with a meaning
Yo you ain't got to hide what your feeling
Yo you ain't got to lie when you're speaking

[Chorus]
Yo she a diva not a keeper
Yo tell her come jump in the beemer
No I don't want to fight for no reason
Yo I gonna lie girl I feel ya
Yo she made me go so crazy
Yo she got my heartbeat racing
Yo why you wanna act fugazi
Yo you ain't nothing like these ladies

Yo you ain't nothing like these hoes
Yo you been living this life before
Yo I don't wanna to fight no more
Yo when I'm with the guys on tour
Yo I raise the roof when I step in
Hit casino get the bets in
We be D low when we texting
Yo she ain't no fool to be messed with

[Outro]
Lord father please forgive her
I spend one day she can't listen
She don't practice what she preach
She gon tell me she gon leave
Skits mental she's so jealous
That's my girl my Cinderella
Ride or die we slide together
She make my life so much betterEmbed
