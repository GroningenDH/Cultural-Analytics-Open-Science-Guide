Overseas Lyrics[Chorus: Young Adz]
The year has just started and right now, I'm lookin' for cribs overseas
I'm givin' my lady some drivin' lessons in a hundred-grand Jeep
When you see me in public, no photos, man, I need some privacy please
Good girl, she just sat on my face now she's sayin' her legs have gone weak
Bad, bad, see the jakes outside, now I'm flushin' the work down the toilet
Mad, mad, Richard Mille, a crib by the port and it's imported
Sad, sad, if you knew the truth 'bout that nigga then it would get awkward
And I know that nigga get money now, I am the nigga that taught him

[Verse 1: Young Adz]
Bro, I get the birds in, fuck a drought
Worker is misbehavin', chuck him out
I get the money, money from her house
Out in a lovely, lovely country town
I said, if you care about her, fly her out
Go to the Louis store and buy it now
I'ma keep pourin' 'til I'm runnin' out
I just hit it from the back, she scared, she runnin' out
Ooh, young and lit, money keep on comin' in
Ooh, I keep a rock band on standby, pull up and drum that shit
Ooh, deep in it, I'ma swim, hand on heart, I love this chick
Ooh, all them niggas 'round me family, love them on some brother shit

[Verse 2: Central Cee]
She suck my soul, she done it like Ash Kaash, I keep on gettin' them flashbacks
I was OT so I had to bash, I almost thought about gettin' a cab back
Do it like Rico and video that, if we upload it,  it'll probably get some backlash
Backshots, she got the ripple effect, it's too temptin' and I can't help but slap that
Fuck that, pull out, I don't wanna be a dad yet
Plan B, girl, you gotta swallow that tablet
The way that she handle it, this one talented
Pum-pum soakin', feel like I'm paddlin'
Back come 'round, I'm a fan of it
Ride on a bike one time and saddle it (Oh)
Ayo, her doctor workin' wonders
Damn, that's a big circumference (Oh)
Get her wet, she don't need no lube
On the fortieth floor, you should see the views (Alright)
She don't wanna send me her pussy on Snapchat, madman, I don't wanna leak your nudes
How do I say it without seemin' rude? (Huh)
I just wanna see if it's cute
Shake that back like a video vixen
This one here don't wanna be in my tunes
She wanna go Nobu just for the Snap
If I pay for the tab, you best eat your food
Word on the road is Cench get a hunnid a show
This ho' wan' see if it's true
Posh ting, she don't wanna be with the squares no more, she said she wanna be with the goons
Thought she could hack it, not active, too smoky, now she wanna leave the room

[Verse 3: Dirtbike LB]
I love the trap (Trap)
Quarter milli on cars ain't never enough (Enough)
Couple milli, I put it aside, cop me a villa in Marbs (In Marbs)
She need ten racks for her arse, I said, bro, "I'll put that on my dargs" (Put that on my dargs)
My killers still swervin' the Rona but that ain't the reason for masks (Yeah)
I fill up the drum and it's kickin' away, spin it back like I'm target (Yeah)
I sat in my kitchen, I'm whippin' away and I'm droppin' off white with no garlic
It's a carousel when I'm spinnin' the tray, hate when my flight is delayed (Delayed)
I tell my lil' nigga, "Go flex in my Rollie, no money to waste" (Waste)
