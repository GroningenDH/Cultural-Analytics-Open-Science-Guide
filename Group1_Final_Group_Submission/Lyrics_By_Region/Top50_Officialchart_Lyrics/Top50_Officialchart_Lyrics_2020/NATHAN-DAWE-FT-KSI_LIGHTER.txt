Lighter Lyrics[Intro: Ella Henderson & KSI]
I used to think I couldn't be without you, be without you
Now that you’re gone, I feel happy as hell (KSI, Nathan Dawe, ah)

[Bridge: Ella Henderson]
When you said it was over
I knew I'd fallen too deep
You made my world feel perfect
Then pulled it from under my feet

[Pre-Chorus: Ella Henderson]
I cried for a minute
For a while, I was tryin' to figure out what went wrong
Now I finally get it
And I see I don’t need you to be here, I'm movin' on

[Chorus: Ella Henderson & KSI]
I used to think I couldn't be without you, be without you
Now that you're gone, I feel happy as hell
Weight off of me
I can breathe without you, breathe without you
Now that you're gone, I feel lighter
I used to think I couldn't be without you, be without you
Now that you're gone, I feel happy as hell
Weight off of me
I can breathe without you, breathe without you (Ayy, ayy)
Now that you’re gone, I feel lighter (Nathan)

I’m feelin' so good like a fat man with a peng ting (Yeah)
Feelin’ so high like a black Yao Ming (Ayy)
Call me Godzilla 'cause I got a big part (Uh)
Went through war, got a purple heart
Needed my space, time, recovery
Now man's ace, quick, summary
New discovery, losin' that weight
Post on the ’Gram 'cause I'm just bait
I'm way too slick with it (Woo), John Wick with it (Woo)
I'm takin' bare shots in a quick minute (Ayy)
More drinks with it, bare sick with it (Come on)
Still end up in a bed with a chick in it (Mad)
VVS1 on my chain, bust down
Been through a lot, now a man's got a crown (It's mad)
KSI verified, stay schemin', self-believin', you know I

[Chorus: Ella Henderson]
I used to think I couldn't be without you, be without you
Now that you're gone, I feel happy as hell
Weight off of me
I can breathe without you, breathe without you
Now that you're gone, I feel lighter
I used to think I couldn't be without you, be without you
Now that you're gone, I feel happy as hell
Weight off of me
I can breathe without you, breathe without you
Now that you're gone, I feel lighter (Yeah, mm)
[Pre-Chorus: Ella Henderson]
I cried for a minute
For a while, I was tryin' to figure out what went wrong
Now I finally get it
And I see, I don't need you to be here, I'm movin' on (Oh, no, oh)

[Chorus: Ella Henderson]
I used to think I couldn't be without you, be without you
Now that you're gone, I feel happy as hell
Weight off of me
I can breathe without you, breathe without you
Now that you're gone, I feel lighter

[Outro: Ella Henderson]
(Gone) I feel lighter
(Gone) I feel lighter
(Gone) I feel lighter
(Gone) I feel lighter
(Gone) I feel lighter
(Gone) I feel lighter (Oh, no)
Now that you're gone, I feel lighter12Embed
