Dinner Guest Lyrics[Intro: AJ Tracey]
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: AJ Tracey]
Cartier frames, and a turtle neck (Fancy)
Parents always love me as a dinner guest (They do)
Had the wins, but I'm not a winner yet (Not yet)
If you're tryna make a pass, I'ma intercept (Let's go)
Got a dog up in the club, I ain't bring a pet (Boom, boom, boom)
Covered in the ice, I ain't tryna sweat (Bling, blaow)
We can make some bread, we can split a cheque (But, but)
I ain't back and forthin' on the internet (No, sir)

[Verse 1: MoStack]
When I think of it
Babe, you'd be a ten out of ten if you never smoke cigarette
But can I blow your back just a little bit?
Ay, rudeboy, you messing with a bigger fish
It ain't over 'til the fat lady sings, tell your mum, "Grab a mic"
You lookin' like a snack, baby, can I get a bite?
Don't pull it on a plate
'Member when we touched in my bed? I'll never say

[Verse 2: AJ Tracey]
One of dem man got a touch, mandem, own up
Stop the drillin' in my merch, you're a doughnut
Young boy made him so much money that he's grown up
Fuck, if you're my centre rock, let's get you blown up
Posh girls wanna take me back to their yard
I don't care if pops is racist, tell your dad, "I'm a star"
And a watch that's on this wrist, I put that on a card
We put bricks up on the strip and now there's bricks in the yard

Parents always love me as a dinner guest (They do)
Had the wins, but I'm not a winner yet (Not yet)
If you're tryna make a pass, I'ma intercept (Let's go)
Got a dog up in the club, I ain't bring a pet (Boom, boom, boom)
Covered in the ice, I ain't tryna sweat (Bling, blaow)
We can make some bread, we can split a cheque (But, but)
I ain't back and forthin' on the internet (No, sir)

[Verse 3: MoStack]
I only go back and forth with the chicks I like
Nah, I'm joking, I'm moist and I'm kinda shy
But I just mixed my drinks, so I feel the vibe
I'm so drunk, I might DM Jorja Smith tonight
She's got a wedding ring and she's in my ride
Blood, I ain't even married, but I kissed a bride
I'm a pop star now, stop wylin' out
But I won't lie, I kinda miss riding out

[Verse 4: AJ Tracey]
I was on a fine line with them ables out
I don't play for NBA, but I may ball out
My brothers all in order, the heat in the corner
My broski will make this Smith sing like it's Jorja
I used to always keep it easy with a jiggle back
And one kiss is all it takes, I could give you that
But I'm not gonna do her, I ain't with all that
And now I'm playing by new rules, I'll just give her back
[Chorus: AJ Tracey]
Cartier frames, and a turtle neck (Fancy)
Parents always love me as a dinner guest (They do)
Had the wins, but I'm not a winner yet (Not yet)
If you're tryna make a pass, I'ma intercept (Let's go)
Got a dog up in the club, I ain't bring a pet (Boom, boom, boom)
Covered in the ice, I ain't tryna sweat (Bling, blaow)
We can make some bread, we can split a cheque (But, but)
I ain't back and forthin' on the internet (No, sir)

[Bridge: MoStack & AJ Tracey]
I ain't goin' back and forth 'cause I'm never listenin'
If you ain't gettin' money keep the social distance
Burbs on my shirt like I'm at a Christenin'
Burberry front row, me, Odell, glistening
I came here to Parley boo, to Madlib
Real G's don't do balloons
Then I'm fake, white Air Forces, they lookin' like Aitch
I don't wanna force it, but she's looking like bae

[Chorus: AJ Tracey]
Cartier frames, and a turtle neck (Fancy)
Parents always love me as a dinner guest (They do)
Had the wins, but I'm not a winner yet (Not yet)
If you're tryna make a pass, I'ma intercept (Let's go)
Got a dog up in the club, I ain't bring a pet (Boom, boom, boom)
Covered in the ice, I ain't tryna sweat (Bling, blaow)
We can make some bread, we can split a cheque (But, but)
I ain't back and forthin' on the internet (No, sir)4Embed
