Rover Lyrics[Intro: S1MBA]
Shorty said she coming with her bredrins
'Cause she saw a young nigga pull up in a Rover
Now she say she wanna come over, yeah
But I don't want no love
I just wanna make the mu-la-la, yeah
The mu-la-la
I just wanna make the mu-la-la
Got 'em all screaming ooh-la-la, yeah

[Chorus: S1MBA]

Now she say she wanna come over, yeah
But I don't want no love
I just wanna make the mu-la-la, yeah

Got 'em all screaming ooh-la-la, yeah

[Verse 1: S1MBA]
I don't want no love
You know me, I only think about funds
Me, I'm tryna do my own ting on my ones
I'm sorry darling, I don't want no hugs, yeah, yeah, yeah
Had a couple gyally try to hold me down
But they ain't my queen, they can't take my crown
They tried to claim me like lost and found
But I only got love for the P's and the pounds, yeah, yeah, yeah
I love being paid
I don't want you, no, I don't want bae
Tryna get my funds up in numerous ways
Couldn't give a damn what a nigga gotta say

Oh, you think I'm bluffing
When I say no cuffing
