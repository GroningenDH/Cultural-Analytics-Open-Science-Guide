Own It Lyrics[Chorus: Stormzy]
Own it
Girl, you just own it
'Cause your body's on fire
Show me how to control it
And go hit your spliff and get higher
Girl, I love how you roll it
I put my hand there, hold it
I'ma be right by ya
I'ma be right by ya
I'ma be right by ya
I'ma be right by ya

[Verse 1: Stormzy & Burna Boy]
Lighters up, lighters up, one time, lighters up
Pulled up in the party, when you saw me, I was lightin' up my J
So go ahead and brighten up my day
Lighters in the air when you lighting up the rave
And it's feelin' like I met you here before ('Fore)
Girl, I felt your presence when they let you through the door (Door)
Never had a bruddah give you everything and more
So I take a little piece and then the rest of it is yours
Mi amore, I
E don tey wey I don dey I tell you
But, girl, you think say nah play (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
I know no wetin you dey do me
Wey just dey scatter my brain (Ah, scatter my brain)
Thug lovin' when I put you in your place
I can tell you love it, just by lookin' in your face
It's the way that you wind up your waist, I'm so in awe
Girl you never have to worry 'bout nothing
You know it's all yours, you know you
You might also like[Chorus: Stormzy & Burna Boy]
Own it
Girl, you just own it
'Cause your body's on fire
Show me how to control it
And go hit your spliff and get higher
Girl, I love how you roll it
I put my hand there, hold it
I'ma be right by ya
I'ma be right by ya
I'ma be right by ya
I'ma be right by ya
(Everybody, body, body, body, body oluwaburna ti de)

[Verse 2: Ed Sheeran]
Lights down for the one I love
Right now (Right now), we never looked better
Forget our friends, girl, I love it when we chill together
And ain't nobody gonna feel what we feel together
She want a kiss, I, I want another one
You got a sick vibe, I wanted more than one
Up to now, nobody knew where I was comin' from
We got the same mind, so I don't wanna waste time
Bring it to me, come by, that's what I need
That's right, kissin' your cheek, one time
I used to love bein' alone (Alone), but now I can't stand it
I'm reachin' out my palm (Palm) for you to put your hand in (Ah-ahh)
Girl, you are the one and I don't understand it (Ooh yeah)
How you lighten up the room with your glow (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause girl, you just-
[Chorus: Burna Boy & Ed Sheeran]
Own it (Own it)
Girl, you just own it (Own it)
'Cause your body's on fire (Fire)
Show me how to control it
And go hit your spliff and get higher (Higher)
Girl, I love how you roll it (I love how you roll it)
I put my hand there (I put my hand there), hold it
I'ma be right by ya
I'ma be right by ya
I'ma be right by ya
I'ma be right by ya
