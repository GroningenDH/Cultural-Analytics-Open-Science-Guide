Rain Lyrics[Intro: Aitch & Lil Juice]
Yeah
(Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up)

[Pre-Chorus: Aitch]
I said, "Say my name" (Say it)
First class flight to LA
As soon as I land, bill a paper plane (Uh)
Soon touch back in the ends
110 on the M, tryna' take a chase (Skrrt-skrrt)
Big fat stack in my bag
When I un-zip that, finna' make it rain

[Chorus: AJ Tracey]
Cuh, when we run down, it's rain
Right wrist and left wrist, that's rain
She said, "Wagwan, what's going on?"
"Why am I wet?" Gyal, that's rain
Cuh, when we run down, it's rain
Right wrist and left wrist, that's rain
She said, "Wagwan, what's going on?"
"Why am I wet?" Gyal, that's rain (Yeah)

[Verse 1: AJ Tracey]
Me and our kid doin' up money
Gyal on curry, neck McFlurry (Bling-blaow)
When you snap your receipts, that's funny (Ha)
Your jeans say p's, but your bank says bummy (Ah)
I was Looney before I made tunes
Now I'm AJ, but my AP's Bugs Bunny (Bling)
Big boogers in my watch, that's runny (Blaow)
No drip, when I flick this, man hurry (Ching)
I got the gyal of your dreams on her knees
In my inbox, tryna call AJ 'Hunny' (Mwah)
I go tape, make it rain or sunny
I came from the dirt so we keep shit muddy (Yeah)
Arabic dial, big rocks, it's flooded (Yeah)
See me, the habibtis, dem love it (Mwah)
All up on the pitch, Kante, man shovin'
McLovin', run jokes, get blooded (Baow-baow)
These kicks on my feet from Virgil
No van Dijk, I'm on slime like Keenan
Bro got the cannon, he'll bang it no reason (Baow)
Since '08, it's been get money season (Baow-baow)
Suh it guh, let's get it (Yeah)
I've spent man's drip on the jail, take credit (Brr)
Got smoke for the opps, but they think that's deaded
Snakes show skin around me, get shedded (Baow-baow)

I said, "Say my name" (Woo!)
First class flight to LA
As soon as I land, bill a paper plane (Uh)
Soon touch back in the ends
110 on the M, tryna' take a chase (Skrrt-skrrt)
Big fat stack in my bag
When I un-zip that, finna' make it rain

[Chorus: AJ Tracey]
Cuh, when we run down, it's rain (Splash)
Right wrist and left wrist, that's rain (Bling)
She said, "Wagwan, what's going on?" (What? Huh?)
"Why am I wet?" Gyal, that's rain (Blaow)
Cuh, when we run down, it's rain (Splash)
Right wrist and left wrist, that's rain (Bling)
She said, "Wagwan, what's going on?" (Huh?)

[Verse 2: Aitch]
Yeah, sick of some rappers and that
But I stay doing me, never cap on a track (Wah)
Gelato pack in a bag
Then I throw up a M, got the map on my back (Uh)
She make it clap for the snap
Yeah, the back wasn't bad but there's no way I'm tackling that (No)
I'm wit' ya gyal on some 'yak in the gaff
Bro tryna stack in the trap (Stack in the trap)
Said I'm too young and my game's all talk
But she got buss down like AJ's chain
And psychodrama, the bitch like Dave
Yo, what can I say? Man, the brain's insane (Ah-ah)
Ten for the two-tone subby
And ten for the new blueface when I rate 'em plain (Yeah, aight)
Still come through and make it rain
Turn up, stay lit, burn up, get paid
Two-two peng ones giving man stress
I delete 'em both, I'm so indecisive (Woo)
Next gyal tryna attack man
Goin' on crazy but I think I like it (Woo)
More time, I lose my head
But then I get stressed 'cause it's so hard to find it
Think I got time for a side chick?
No way, this not ridin' in my whip (Skrrt)
[Pre-Chorus: Aitch]
I said, "Say my name" (Say it)
First class flight to LA
As soon as I land, bill a paper plane (Uh)
Soon touch back in the ends
110 on the M, tryna' take a chase (Skrrt-skrrt)
Big fat stack in my bag
When I un-zip that, finna' make it rain

[Chorus: AJ Tracey]
Cuh, when we run down, it's rain
Right wrist and left wrist, that's rain
She said, "Wagwan, what's going on?"
"Why am I wet?" Gyal, that's rain
Cuh, when we run down, it's rain
Right wrist and left wrist, that's rain
She said, "Wagwan, what's going on?"
"Why am I wet?" Gyal, that's rain

[Outro: Aitch]
