Thought I could be single forever till I met you
Usually don't be fallin', be fallin', fallin' fast

Was to get back at your ex lover but before you leave
Usually I would never, would never even care
Baby, I know she creepin', I feel it in the air

I try to make you stay, but your

Your savage love
Your savage lo-lo-love
