Better Off Without You Lyrics[Verse 1]
I thought my world was crumbling
When I woke up and you weren't in my bed
And I was left here wondering how
You could walk away and never turn back

[Pre-Chorus]
Tried to right all your wrongs
I never thought that I'd be lost
But I found the truth
I was searching for me in you

[Chorus]
Now I'm better off without you
And it's finally clear to see
That the person I was missing
It's not you, it's me
Now I'm better off without you
And I've never felt so free
'Cause the person I was missing
It's not you, it's me

[Verse 2]
I tried so hard to please you (To please you)
But nothing that I did would work
Oh, and all the things that we've been through
Now it's time to start putting me first
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Tried to right all your wrongs (All your wrongs)
I never thought that I'd be lost
But I found the truth (The truth)
I was searching for me in you (Oh, oh, oh)

[Chorus]
Now I'm better off without you (Without you)
And it's finally clear to see (Oh, it's finally clear to see)
That the person I was missing
It's not you, it's me (Oh)
Now I'm better off without you (Without you)
And I've never felt so free (No, I've never felt so free)
'Cause the person I was missing (It's not you)
It's not you, it's me (Yeah)

[Post-Chorus]
Better off, better off, I'm (I'm)
Better off without you (Oh, oh, oh, I)
Better off, better off, I'm
Better off without you

[Bridge]
I thought my world was crumbling
When I woke up and you weren't in my bed
And I was left here wondering how
You could walk away and never turn back
[Chorus]
('Cause I'm better off)
Now I'm better off without you
And I've never felt so free
'Cause the person I was missing
It's not you, it's me (Yeah)

[Post-Chorus]
Better off, better off, I'm (I'm)
Better off without you (Oh, oh, oh)
Better off, better off, I'm
Better off without youEmbed
