Secrets Lyrics[Chorus]
I don't know 'bout you, 'bout you
'Bout you, you-you-you-you-you
There's something in his eyes
He's keeping secrets
I don't know 'bout you, bout you
'Bout you, you-you-you-you-you
There's something in his eyes
He's keeping secrets

[Verse 1: RAYE]
What a way to drop a bombshell baby
Guess you really didn't think I'd found out
Hear the silence crying
In the room on the side with the lights out
Know what you're feeling, oh-oh
Know what you're feeling, oh-oh

[Pre-Chorus: Regard & RAYE]
Fuckin' with my heart and head
(And again and again and again and again)
Fallen out of love again, yeah
(And again and again and again and again)
Rollin' up my blunt in bed (In my bed, in my bed, in my bed, in my bed)
Fallen out of love again
It's been a very, very long night
Sittin' with my girls, sippin' wine like
You might also like[Chorus: Regard & RAYE]
I don't know 'bout you, 'bout you
'Bout you, you-you-you-you-you
There's something in his eyes
He's keeping secrets
I don't know 'bout you, bout you
'Bout you, you-you-you-you-you
There's something in his eyes
He's keeping secrets
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, woah-oh

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2: RAYE]
Oh, oh
I'ma have to take a mugshot, baby
What you're doin' to me is criminal, out here
On my knees, I'm prayin'
In the room on the floor with the lights down
Clothes in the kitchen, oh-oh-oh
I'ma light it and leave it for you

[Pre-Chorus: Regard & RAYE]
Fuckin' with my heart and head
(And again and again and again and again)
Fallen out of love again, yeah
(And again and again and again and again)
Rollin' up my blunt in bed (In my bed, in my bed, in my bed, in my bed)
Fallen out of love again
It's been a very, very long night
Sittin' with my girls, sippin' wine like
[Chorus: Regard & RAYE]
I don't know 'bout you, 'bout you
'Bout you, you-you-you-you-you
There's something in his eyes
He's keeping secrets
I don't know 'bout you, bout you
'Bout you, you-you-you-you-you
There's something in his eyes
He's keeping secrets
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, woah-oh

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus: Regard & RAYE]
I don't know 'bout you, 'bout you
'Bout you, you-you-you-you-you
There's something in his eyes
He's keeping secrets
I don't know 'bout you, bout you
'Bout you, you-you-you-you-you
There's something in his eyes
He's keeping secrets6Embed
