Oh, oh
Oh, oh

One foot in front of the other, babe
One breath leads to another, yeah
Just keep moving, oh, oh
Look within for the strength today
Listen out for the voice to say
Just keep moving, oh, oh

Figure it out, figure it out, but don't stop moving
Go, go, go
Figure it out, figure it out, you can do this

So, my love, keep on running
You gotta get through today, yeah, yeah
There, my love, keep on running
Gotta keep those tears at bay, oh
Oh, my love, don't stop burning
Gonna send them up in flames
In flames
