Jumanji Lyrics[Intro: AntiWave]
(AntiWave)

[Chorus]
Ring ring 'pon the hands free
Piff ting called Ashanti
I zing zing like the grand prix
She fling-fling off the panties
And them tings extra fancy
She know just what she came to do
She wanna live life jumanji
Girl you know I got just the place for you, oh

[Verse 1]
From the hips to the waist y'know
Girl I'm loving your ratio
Let me grip on and take control
Have to turn up the radio
Girl you know that's out the question
I swear your body is a blessing
Big batty girl you got my attention
Wow, I put that body through some testing

[Chorus]
Ring ring 'pon the hands free
Piff ting called Ashanti
I zing zing like the grand prix
She fling-fling off the panties
And them tings extra fancy
She know just what she came to do
She wanna live life jumanji
Girl you know I got just the place for you, oh
