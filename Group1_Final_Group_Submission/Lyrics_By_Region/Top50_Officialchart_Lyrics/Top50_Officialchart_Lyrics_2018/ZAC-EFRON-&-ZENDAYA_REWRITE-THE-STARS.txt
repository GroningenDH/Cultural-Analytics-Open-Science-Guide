Rewrite the Stars Lyrics[Verse 1: Zac Efron]
You know I want you
It's not a secret I try to hide
I know you want me
So don't keep sayin' our hands are tied
You claim it's not in the cards
And fate is pulling you miles away and out of reach from me
But you're here in my heart
So who can stop me if I decide that you're my destiny?

[Chorus: Zac Efron]
What if we rewrite the stars?
Say you were made to be mine?
Nothing could keep us apart
You'd be the one I was meant to find
It's up to you and it's up to me
No one can say what we get to be
So why don't we rewrite the stars?
Maybe the world could be ours tonight

[Verse 2: Zendaya]
You think it's easy?
You think I don't want to run to you?
But there are mountains
And there are doors that we can't walk through
I know you're wonderin' why
Because we're able to be just you and me within these walls
But when we go outside
You're gonna wake up and see that it was hopeless after all
You might also like[Chorus: Zendaya]
No one can rewrite the stars
How can you say you'll be mine?
Everything keeps us apart
And I'm not the one you were meant to find
It's not up to you, it's not up to me
When everyone tells us what we can be
How can we rewrite the stars?
Say that the world can be ours tonight

[Bridge: Both, Zendaya, Zac Efron]
All I want is to fly with you
All I want is to fall with you
So just give me all of you
It feels impossible
It's not impossible
Is it impossible?
Say that it's possible

[Chorus: Both, Zac Efron]
How do we rewrite the stars?
Say you were made to be mine
Nothing can keep us apart
'Cause you are the one I was meant to find
It's up to you and it's up to me
No one can say what we get to be
Why don't we rewrite the stars?
Changin' the world to be ours
[Outro: Zendaya]
You know I want you
It's not a secret I try to hide
But I can't have you
We're bound to break and my hands are tied93Embed
