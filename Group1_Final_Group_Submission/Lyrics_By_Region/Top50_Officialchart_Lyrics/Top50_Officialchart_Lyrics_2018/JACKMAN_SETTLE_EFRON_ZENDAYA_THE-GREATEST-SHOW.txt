The Greatest Show Lyrics[Intro: Ensemble]
Woah
Woah
Woah
Woah
Woah
Woah
Woah
Woah

[Verse 1: Hugh Jackman, Ensemble]
Woah
Ladies and gents, this is the moment you've waited for
Woah
Been searchin' in the dark, your sweat soakin' through the floor
Woah
And buried in your bones, there's an ache that you can't ignore
Takin' your breath, stealin' your mind
And all that was real is left behind

[Pre-Chorus: Hugh Jackman, Ensemble]
Don't fight it, it's comin' for you, runnin' at ya
It's only this moment, don't care what comes after
Your fever dream, can't you see it gettin' closer?
Just surrender 'cause you feel the feelin' takin' over (Oh)
It's fire, it's freedom, it's floodin' open (Oh)
It's a preacher in the pulpit and your blind devotion (Oh)
There's somethin' breakin' at the brick of every wall that's holdin' (Oh)
All that you know, so tell me, do you wanna go?
You might also like[Chorus: Hugh Jackman, Ensemble]
Where it's covered in all the colored lights
Where the runaways are runnin' the night
Impossible comes true, it's takin' over you
Oh, this is the greatest show
We light it up, we won't come down
And the sun can't stop us now
Watchin' it come true, it's takin' over you
Oh, this is the greatest show

[Verse 3: Hugh Jackman, Ensemble]
Woah
Colossal we come, these renegades in the ring
Woah
Where the lost get found and we crown 'em the circus kings

[Pre-Chorus: Hugh Jackman, Ensemble]
Don't fight it, it's comin' for you, runnin' at ya (Don't fight it, it's comin')
It's only this moment, don't care what comes after (It's only this moment)
It's blindin', outshinin' anything that you know (Shinin', shinin')
Just surrender 'cause you're comin' and you wanna go

[Chorus: Hugh Jackman, Ensemble]
Where it's covered in all the colored lights
Where the runaways are runnin' the night
Impossible comes true, intoxicatin' you
Oh, this is the greatest show
We light it up, we won't come down
And the sun can't stop us now
Watchin' it come true, it's takin' over you
Oh, this is the greatest show (Hey, hey)
[Bridge: Hugh Jackman, Ensemble]
It's everything you ever want (Hey, hey)
It's everything you ever need (Hey, hey)
And it's here right in front of you (This is where you wanna be)
This is where you wanna be (Hey, hey)
It's everything you ever want (Hey, hey)
It's everything you ever need (Hey, hey)
And it's here right in front of you (This is what you want)
This is where you wanna be (Hey, hey, hey, hey)

[Interlude: Keala, Ensemble]
This is where you wanna be
Where it's covered in all the colored lights
Where the runaways are runnin' the night (Oh, oh, yeah)
Impossible comes true, it's takin' over you (Hee)
Oh, this is the greatest show
We light it up, we won't come down
And the sun can't stop us now
Watchin' it come true, it's takin' over you

[Chorus: Zac Efron, Zac Efron & Zendaya, Ensemble]
This is the greatest show
Where it's covered in all the colored lights
Where the runaways are runnin' the night
Impossible comes true, it's takin' over you
Oh, this is the greatest show
We light it up, we won't come down
And the walls can't stop us now
Watchin' it come true, it's takin' over you
Oh, this is the greatest show
[Post-Chorus: Zac Efron & Zendaya, Ensemble]
'Cause everything you want is right in front of you
(Oh, this is the greatest show)
And you see the impossible is comin' true
(Oh, this is the greatest show)
And the walls can't stop us now, yeah
(Oh, this is the greatest show)
(Oh, this is the greatest show)

[Outro: All]
Oh, this is the greatest show
Oh, this is the greatest show
Oh, this is the greatest show
Oh, this is the greatest show (Oh, this is)
Oh, this is the greatest show (This is)
Oh, this is the greatest show (The greatest show)
