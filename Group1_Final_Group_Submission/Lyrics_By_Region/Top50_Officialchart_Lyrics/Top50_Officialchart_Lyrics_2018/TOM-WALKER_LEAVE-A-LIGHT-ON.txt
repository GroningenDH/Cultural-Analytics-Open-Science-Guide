Leave a Light On Lyrics[Verse 1]
The second someone mentioned you were all alone
I could feel the trouble coursin' through your veins
Now I know it's got a hold
Just a phone call left unanswered had me sparkin' up
These cigarettes won't stop me wonderin' where you are
Don't let go, keep a hold

[Pre-Chorus]
If you look into the distance, there's a house upon the hill
Guidin' like a lighthouse
To a place where you'll be safe to feel our grace
'Cause we've all made mistakes
If you've lost your way

[Chorus]
I will leave the light on
I will leave the light on
I will leave the light on
I will leave the light on

[Verse 2]
Tell me what's been happenin', what's been on your mind
Lately, you've been searchin' for a darker place to hide
That's alright
But if you carry on abusing, you'll be robbed from us
I refuse to lose another friend to drugs
Just come home, don't let go

If you look into the distance, there's a house upon the hill
Guidin' like a lighthouse
To a place where you'll be safe to feel our grace
'Cause we've all made mistakes
If you've lost your way

[Chorus]
I will leave the light on
I will leave the light on
I will leave the light on
I will leave the light on
I will leave the light on

[Bridge]
If you look into the distance, there's a house upon the hill
Guidin' like a lighthouse
It's a place where you'll be safe to feel our grace
And if you've lost your way, if you've lost your way
I will leave the light on
And I know you're down and out now, but I need you to be brave
Hidin' from the truth ain't gonna make this all okay
I see your pain
If you don't feel our grace and you've lost your way

[Outro]
Well, I will leave the light on
I will leave the light on
'Cause I will leave the light on31Embed
