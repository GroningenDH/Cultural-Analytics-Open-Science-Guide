Barking Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Mokuba Lives Beats
Yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I might link my ting from Barkin'
7 a.m. in the mornin'
She's callin', I'm yawnin'
She's jarrin', no stallin'
I might link my ting from Barkin'
7 a.m. in the mornin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
She's callin', I'm yawnin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
She's jarrin', no stallin'
I might link my ting from Barkin' (In the mornin')
7 a.m. in the mornin'
She's callin', I'm yawnin' (I'm yawnin')
She's jarrin', no stallin'
I might link my ting from Barkin' (Yawnin')
7 a.m. in the mornin'
She's callin', I'm yawnin' (I'm yawnin')
She's jarrin', no stallin'

[Verse]
I'm icy (I'm Icy)
I got a tick from my head to my feet, that's Nike
And that's pricey
You see them guys over there? They ain't like me
I got a Portuguese ting, not wifey
She said my temper's tiny
I got two different worlds like Miley
You hit me up, that's unlikely (Likely)
But I walked in the room with a fresh trim (Fresh trim)
Showin' my Colgate teeth (My teeth)
Yeah, they're lookin' at me (Lookin' at me)
Sayin' "Can I get a pic for the 'Gram, just like AJ T"
No wonder they hate on me (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause I'm makin' P's and they see these clothes
Yeah, I get 'em for free

[Bridge]
Many guys (Many guys), many, many, many guys
Hate me and it's true, too bad
I just stunt on you, too bad
I don't look like you
Like many, many, many guys (Many guys, yeah)
Hate me and it's true, too bad
I just stunt on you, like too bad
