Lyricist: MC HotDog Composer: MC HotDog / Ryan.B Arranger: Ryan B You have no retreat for a long time but you never give in Invading my internet God damn it and crying at every turn Why do you care so much but even want to bet I can’t stand you anymore You’ll always be such a beautiful girl If you’re a disaster, you’re that liquid poison A woman’s heart needles me from the bottom of my heart I&#39;m fishing for your seabed, relying on you, why is it so hard to deal with, when love turns into trouble, you&#39;re like Detective Conan, you&#39;re like cutting out my appendix, blissfully blissful, what a mess we&#39;ve made, I&#39;ve lost my eighth life, I feel like I&#39;m bad, what do I do? Nothing is right Hey, are you sober? It’s clearly a lover. It’s like an enemy. There’s no atmosphere. How long have you not kissed? From love to hate, two invisible people are fighting for everything. This is a war. Why are you pretending to be cool when you care so much but even bet on being angry You’re difficult enough to get along with You hacked into my internet goddammit and cry every now and then Why do you care so much but bet even being angry This feels real or virtual Humph really You can’t escape the palm of your message I live in your 4G sweetly buried in the voice can’t do without your shadow WIFI is like a spider web and I’m the dead dragonfly on it I’ve given up a long time ago like being tied up by you I made a date, my heart was wild, but now it’s deserted, you lied today, no clam, did you go home, I don’t want to answer the tiger’s head, the snake’s tail, it’s obviously a lover, it’s like an enemy, there’s no atmosphere, how long have there been no kisses, love breeds hate Two invisible people are fighting for everything because this is a war You have no way out for a long time but you never admit defeat Please stop pretending to be cool Why do you care so much but even bet on your anger You are difficult enough to get along with You invaded my network Lu Tian kills you and still cries at every turn Why do you care so much but even want to gamble when you are angry I understand that you hurt, I hurt, please don’t blame me because we’re just a pair of grievances, you’ve never backed down, but you’ve always refused to admit defeat, please don’t pretend to be cool, don’t cry, why do you care so much, but you want to bet on you even when you’re angry? Difficult enough to get along with, you hacked into my network, don’t pretend to be cool, cry at every turn, but even bet on anger
