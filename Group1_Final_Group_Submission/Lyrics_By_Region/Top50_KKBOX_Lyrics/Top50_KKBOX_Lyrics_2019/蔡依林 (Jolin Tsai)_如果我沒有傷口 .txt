Lyricist: Liao Tingyi Composer: Song Nianyu can&#39;t find a suitable trend to accommodate the pain that falls from my eyes. When I am strong and praised by everyone, how dare I say Oh~ I am sad because I have gradually learned to be silent in love. We secretly fight for what is called superiority Candy, no one will be outdone If I don’t have a wound, is it a beautiful achievement (who will praise me) If I don’t have a wound, why worry about the courage to run away I can’t find a suitable lens to whitewash what I see from your eyes as a perfect being After zooming in and inspecting it, it looks like I’m oh~ It’s too useless, I’m gradually forgetting to call for help in love We dodge each other A ball called loneliness No one will give up If I don’t have a wound, is it a beautiful achievement (Who will praise me ) If I don’t have wounds, is it enough? Is it enough to be your opponent? Why did you fall in love? Why did you go together to restore the original dependence? We are not brave. If I don’t have wounds, I can’t feel (Why do I fall in love and why do I go together) You will feel sorry for me (We can be braver by restoring the original dependence) If I don’t have wounds, how can we understand (If you want to fall in love again and tear the package is the answer) Embrace tenderly (love all my gestures)
