Lyricist: Chen Shanni Composer: Chen Shanni Arranger: Chen Shanni The beautiful girl&#39;s relaxed appearance is always difficult to remember The charming boy&#39;s impromptu desire to be happy with his ideal behind his back &quot;Don&#39;t be emotional, don&#39;t miss secretly, don&#39;t look back&quot; The writer hit this Bitter, contrived love roaming, everyone seems to understand the rain but someone cried for you just now Loneliness is just walking a gentle slope to mature but waiting for everything without thinking about it Occasionally clinging to places that are too loud The habit is to be with you The world compromising stubbornly accepts the sum of misunderstandings the most painful feelings are like the deepest lies love is not necessarily true what you are looking for is equal to the calculation you are longing for and is losing hits every passing pass in love roaming everyone seems to understand I don’t understand youth, it’s just the neon lights on the ground after the rain, time is just the repeated happiness of life, it’s just waiting for everything without thinking about coffee, it’s just writing a novel about the city, what’s lost will eventually be lost, what’s missed will eventually meet, it’s raining only But who has just cried for you? Loneliness is just walking a slow slope alone. Maturity is just waiting for everything without thinking. My heart is occasionally persistent in places that are too noisy.
