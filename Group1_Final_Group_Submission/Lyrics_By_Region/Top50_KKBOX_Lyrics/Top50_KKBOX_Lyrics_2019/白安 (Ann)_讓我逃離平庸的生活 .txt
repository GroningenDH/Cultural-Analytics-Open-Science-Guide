Lyricist: Bai An Composer: Bai An Arranger: Li Jianqing I once had it and I lost it too I experienced the ups and downs through the cold and warm seasons Can anyone tell me where to go in the future to be considered wonderful I am just a girl who is looking for it and trying to think Find my own way Let me have wild freedom Let me escape the mediocrity of life Never back down The love I want Even though it&#39;s far away One day I&#39;ll love it all Let me embrace the wounds I hated At least I still feel Support me to move forward When I want to fly to the sky, don’t say sorry. In the future, I want you to belong to me. I want too much. I can’t just let me laugh and cry and stare at loneliness with cold eyes. I have to use my life to explore and follow. The waves go straight to the end Let me have wild freedom Let me escape from the mediocre life Never back down The love I want Even though it&#39;s far away One day I will love it all Let me embrace the wounds I hated At least I still have feelings Support me to move forward When I want to fly to the sky, don&#39;t be sorry to say sorry In the future, I want you to belong to me Let me have wild freedom Let me escape from the mediocre life Never back down When I want to fly, look up and see the blue sky In the future I want you to belong to me
