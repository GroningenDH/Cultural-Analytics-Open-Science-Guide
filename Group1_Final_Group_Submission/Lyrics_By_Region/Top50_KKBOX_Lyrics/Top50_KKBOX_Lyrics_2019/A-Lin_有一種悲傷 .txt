Lyricist: Lin Xiaoqian Composer: Zhang Jianjunwei I am not envious of the sun not shining your past is dark and we are all the same I am too envious of time being able to leave generously without speaking and without hiding there is a kind of sadness that your name stays in my past to accompany me to breathe Decide how I smile I can’t forget There’s a kind of sadness that’s parting from you with a smile Missing you but looking back to back I’m still stubborn I’m left with a photo Oh~ Oh~ Be each other’s roads How can I lose my direction There’s a kind of sadness Oh~ Stay in my past I can&#39;t forget Oh~ There is a kind of sadness that you don&#39;t hesitate to let love become the light on my body Give me warmth but don&#39;t allow me to forget There is a kind of sadness I don&#39;t want to be separated from you and miss you so I look back to back You are all You are a photo together
