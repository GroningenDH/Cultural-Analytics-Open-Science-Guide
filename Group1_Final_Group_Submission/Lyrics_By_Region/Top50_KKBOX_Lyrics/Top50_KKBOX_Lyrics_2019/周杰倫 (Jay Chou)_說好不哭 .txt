Lyricist: Fang Wenshan Composer: Jay Chou lost contact. In my later life, I always listened to others telling me what’s wrong with you and what’s wrong with you. The person I can’t let go of is when there are many people, I stay in the corner and I’m afraid that people will ask me what’s wrong with you. You kept your head down and protected me, didn’t even complain, didn’t even have a phone call, and started to hide, never told me that I’m not used to living alone, after you leave me, you want me to live a good life, afraid of disturbing me, wanting to be free, even at this time, you still care about what others think of my hard work Explaining that it’s not my fault but that you’re going to leave I watched you feel sad to stay but didn’t tell you you’d smile and let go and say no to cry let me go and start hiding from the phone never told me I’m not used to living alone after leaving me want me to live well for fear of disturbing you I am free. At this time, you still care about what others think of me. I try my best to explain that it is not my fault, but you are going to leave. I see you sad, but if you keep me, you don’t say anything. No, but I still cheer for my dream. My heart aches after a long time, and I’m still looking for a reason to wait for me.
