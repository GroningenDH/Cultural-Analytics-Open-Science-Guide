Lyricist: Chen Xuening Composer: Chen Xuening If you hadn’t suddenly broken into my life, how could I let go of the loneliness I held on to? It’s a lie to say it’s not painful. After all, my heart is also made of flesh. When you leave, the rainbow in my heart turns gray. Say no It&#39;s sad, that&#39;s false, if I really never loved that much, I loved a soulless person, the world is black If you didn&#39;t suddenly break into my life, how could I let go of the loneliness I&#39;m holding on to? If you love me, you say you love me. If you don’t do things, I will treat sweet words as the shell of your love for me. If you don’t partake of your sorrow and sorrow, I will also treat the past as charity and don’t care too much about you. From now on, you will only be green in my heart, say you are happy, that’s it It’s a lie Your name is still so profound Every word pierces my heart That sharp pain is red If you hadn’t suddenly entered my life How could I let go of the loneliness I’ve been holding on to If you love me you say you love me If you don’t do things, I will treat sweet words as your body that loves me. If you don’t partake of your sadness, I will treat the past as charity and don’t care too much about you. From now on, you will only be green in my heart. If it weren’t for you Suddenly broke into my life How could I let go of the loneliness that I guarded? If you love me, you say what you love me, but if you don’t do it, I treat sweet words as the shell of your love for me. If I don’t partake of your sadness, I won’t break it. I will also treat the past as a charity. If it weren’t for you suddenly Intruding into my life, how could I let go of the loneliness that I guarded?
