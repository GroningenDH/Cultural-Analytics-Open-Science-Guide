Lyricist: Liu Weifeng Composer: Liu Weifeng said to wander with you, but I returned halfway and fell into the ocean of self-blame I found that I couldn’t do without you and I decided to go back You are no longer where I am I can accept all your bad tempers We can eat a lot together Good things, I can bring you a little sweetness once in a while Just like in the past few years, I will bring you a lot of surprises every day Your heartbreak I can heal my happiness And only you can give us Let’s not be separated again Can we be with you There are too many memories between us. There is no reason to fall in love with you. It just happened that we met you at the beginning of love. I don’t want my future to be not you. I only want to be with you forever. How can I erase it? Can I pick it up again? We will never be apart before the expiration date. Can we be together with you? You only want to be with you forever. While I haven’t passed the expiration date, while you are still willing, can I be with you? There are too many memories between us. It doesn’t make sense to fall in love with you. It’s just a coincidence that I met you at the beginning of love. I don’t want my future to be not you. I just want to be with you forever, while I haven’t expired, while you’re still willing, while I haven’t expired, while you’re still willing
