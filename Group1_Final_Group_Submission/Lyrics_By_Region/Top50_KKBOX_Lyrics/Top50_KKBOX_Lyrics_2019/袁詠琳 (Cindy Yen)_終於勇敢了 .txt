Lyricist: Yuan Yonglin/Atsushi Shimada/MiNE/Chinese Lyricist: Zhang Lanyun Trials, searching and searching, like smoke that can’t be grasped, I still dream of you occasionally, I should hold back even though it hurts, I hide you in my heart, I just want to stride forward, let the sun shine brightly, let the troubles aside, let go of you, let yourself go, you are not allowed at night There are no tears, no insomnia, promise to live brightly, I just want to stride forward, very reluctant to give up, I can say goodbye with a smile, no longer rely on whose shoulders I finally grow up, I am finally brave, I am sure I will be good, goodbye my love every day The first time I walked past that shop, I always used to look inside and you knocked over my coffee. It was the moment we met. Love came. Love left without rehearsing. I remember how many tears I need every day to write an article. In fact, I often mention you, and I still miss it. It’s hard for us to be stubborn. To change, I just want to stride forward, let the sun shine bright, let go of my troubles, let go of yourself, no tears at night, no insomnia Saying goodbye no longer leaning on anyone&#39;s shoulders I finally grew up and finally became brave Goodbye my love Letting go of my hand is hard to hold again There is nothing to be owed Everything that has been experienced will be grace It will take years to forget your face But I know I will let you go somewhere I was so sad before, I still have to be able to say goodbye with a smile, no longer rely on anyone’s shoulders, finally I’ve grown up, I’m brave, it’s fine without you, goodbye my love, goodbye my love
