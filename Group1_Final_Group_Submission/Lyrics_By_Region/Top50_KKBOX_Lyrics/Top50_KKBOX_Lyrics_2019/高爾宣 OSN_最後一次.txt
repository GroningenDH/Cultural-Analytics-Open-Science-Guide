Lyricist: Gao Erxuan OSN Composer: Gao Erxuan OSN Yeah I know So I began to think about how to do those lies and those injuries are not my fault You speak so wildly and unconstrainedly I fell down in that starry sky watching how you describe the disaster we caused I hope that we were on the same page pure love we were on the same thing once so firm if we could go back to the past I ain&#39;t worry bout nothin But you tell me so well I understand Yeah you tell so I believe me I told me so It hurts but you don&#39;t listen I&#39;m just sayin I&#39;m insane I fell into the same trap for three years and a few days You say you believe me but you don&#39;t really believe me You want me to believe you but you don&#39;t It&#39;s you who lied to me Goddamn it&#39;s not that I didn&#39;t realize the goodbye that I kept hidden in my heart Say it again The one last time just say you still love me I keep it in my heart and I close my eyes The one last time yeah I will Remember you well I close my eyes and I close my heart I&#39;ve had enough of the lies I&#39;ve had enough of the lies I&#39;ve had enough of the good I&#39;ve had enough of the bad I&#39;ve had enough of this dream I&#39;ve had enough of this love I&#39;ve had enough of both ends Regardless of success or failure, I am fed up with repeating a battle every day that I don’t even want to win. If you don’t love at an age when you don’t understand love, if you can let it go and forget it, you can’t be afraid. If you can man up, I can’t help it and I don’t want to look like a pussy. nah nah I don’t want to see all this through tears anymore nah nah my vision is blurry like being sentenced to life in prison The sleeves don’t take away a piece of cloud, but I still can’t forget your skirt The one last time I’ll say it again The one last time I’ll tell you that you still love me I keep it in my heart and I close my eyes The one last time yeah I’ll remember it well you and i close my eyes and i close my heart
