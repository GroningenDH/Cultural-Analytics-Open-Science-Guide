Lyricist: Wu Qingfeng / OA: Jolin Tsai / Starr Chen / Stan Dubb / Rhys Fletcher / Richard Craker Composer: OC: Jolin Tsai / Starr Chen / Stan Dubb / Hong Yunhui Yun-Hui Hung / Rhys Fletcher ／Richard Craker The coveted evil grows up with me, grows in the soft and rotten, social nutrition, the scars of the past make me stand firm, those godly and ugly comments, no one is upright, I laughed and cried, what kind of standard is this rushing to decide the survival of the fittest Love me I hate that I am not me. I have something outside. I come from the inside. I listen to who says wrong, right, beautiful and ugly. If you ask me, I look at me and say I am so beautiful. I can’t see my beauty. You are blind and praise your face, but you turn around and spit. In the world of aesthetics, who has the guts to say that it’s absolutely true, I’m false, I’m looking at myself. Which one do I want today? I’ve heard who’s wrong, right, beautiful, and ugly. If you ask me, I’ll see it. If I say I blame beauty, who will push me On? To the next one Carrying too much morality along the way, living makes people breathless, whoever hurts, thinks, talks about irrelevance, don’t worry about getting along too tactfully, the soul is in a dilemma, the positive and negative energies all eat up the beautiful, the ugly, and its own existence You need to love and hate, follow your own preferences, reject your hypocrisy, embrace, want to live prominently, respond to the evil in your heart, who says wrong, right, beautiful, ugly, if you ask me, I say I am strangely beautiful
