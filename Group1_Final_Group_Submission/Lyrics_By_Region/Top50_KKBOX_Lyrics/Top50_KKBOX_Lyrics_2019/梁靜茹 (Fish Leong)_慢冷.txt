Lyricist: Yao Ruolong Composer: Xiao Huangqi seems to have finished speaking, always silent. Sitting in the dark, his eyes are full of night. Feelings are paranoid. The more I love, the more paranoid I don’t believe what I see. I insist that the cracks are just wrinkles. The fiery one gets cold first, but the slow one can’t stop. It’s still boiling. Watching the time willful, running fast, turning around at will, turning slowly. A person who can torture himself, an impulsive person, who never hears and stays. The world is so big that it’s hard for you not to travel. Romance makes you gentle and makes you the most tearful Hold your hand as if nothing happened Hold your hand You are like a passive puppet How ruthless and disgusting spoilers How hot at first but then cold first Slow hot but can&#39;t stop It&#39;s still there Ebullient watching the time, willful, fast running, turning and turning slowly, people who can torture themselves, impulsive people, never hear and stay, this world is so big that it’s hard for you not to travel, romance makes you gentle and makes you the most tearful, love never The enemy&#39;s character is not giving up, but the heart hurts the most. I always remember the throbbing of being fiercely loved. How it was hot at first, but then became cold first. Slowly hot, but it can&#39;t stop. It&#39;s still boiling. Watching time willful, running fast, turning at will, turning slowly, and getting cold. Impulsive people who can torture themselves can never hear and stay. The world is so big that it is difficult for you not to travel. Romance makes you gentle and makes you the most tearful.
