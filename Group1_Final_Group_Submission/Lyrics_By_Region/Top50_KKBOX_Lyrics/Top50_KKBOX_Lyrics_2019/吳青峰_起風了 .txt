Lyricist: Miguo Composer: Takahashi Yu Arranger: Liu Huyi I once turned my youth into her, and I once popped out the heart of midsummer with my fingertips. Let it go with the flow. Stop and go along the way and follow the traces of youth drifting. A moment before the station, I was a little hesitant and couldn’t help laughing. The feeling of nostalgia is still unavoidable, and the sky in Nagano is still so warm. The wind is blowing from the past. I first met the world in the past. Looking at the sky in front of my eyes, I am willing to go through fire and water to walk it again. I have been wandering around in this world, turned over the years, different sides of the face, caught off guard, and your smile broke into me. I was unable to extricate myself from the size of the world, and I was addicted to it. Dreams, words can’t be true or false, no struggle, no fear of jokes, I once turned my youth into something she once pointed out The tip pops out midsummer’s heart is moved, let’s go with the fate, walk against the light, let the wind and rain blow, and stop and go on a short road, there is also a certain distance Enemy sees you again in the cool morning light and smiles very sweet I used to be unable to extricate myself from the size of the world, and I was addicted to it. Dreams can’t be true or false, I can’t make struggles, and I’m not afraid of jokes. I once turned my youth into her, and I once popped out the heart of midsummer at my fingertips. Let’s go as the night wind blows. The white hair on your temples heals the scars left by memories Your eyes are mixed with bright and dark smiles blooming I still marvel at the size of the world I am also intoxicated by childhood love words No truth or falsehood left No struggles and meaningless jokes I will eventually give back my youth She went with the wind along with the midsummer&#39;s heart that popped out from her fingertips. In the name of love, are you still willing?
