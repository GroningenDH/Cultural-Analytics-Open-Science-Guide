Lyricist: Shi Rencheng Composer: Zhang Jian Junwei Hey, it’s no surprise that her back is so brisk Hey, you have to understand that people will come and then they will leave Come back a little more and practice self-defense as you pass by the human world. It’s ashamed. As long as you have a chance, you will fall again. Don’t guess again. Did she ever think about coming back? Wake up, you’re fine, she’s not bad, quickly wipe away your tears and see how beautiful the epiphyllum is passing by The world is nothing more than a moment, every moment of shoulder-to-shoulder is nothing more than rubbing shoulders, whoever I have let down, and then I am owed to pass by the world, I have been in this reincarnation, I am a little lucky, maybe I will not owe anyone in the end Woo~~Woo~~ Ha A~~Ha A~~ people There should be hallucinations about love and eternity, and it’s only been a few decades while passing by the world, but it’s only been a few decades for love to have the courage to waste the years. Meeting parting, parting, greed, hatred, love, ignorance and resentment, passing by the world is busy with these, who has an opinion? Could it be that there is no one in my heart, no one to love? How wasteful this world is.
