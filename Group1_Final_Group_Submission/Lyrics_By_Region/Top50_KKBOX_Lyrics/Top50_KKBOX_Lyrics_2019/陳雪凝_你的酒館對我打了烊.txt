Lyricist: Chen Xuening Composer: Chen Xuening When you appeared, you were intoxicated. Time without wine, I looked like a ridiculous poor man, but you never gave me alms. Your tavern closed me. The bullet is loaded in my heart. Please tell me how to carry it from now on. You still smiled and forgiven your tavern closed to me. The promise was a child’s lie. Please tell me how to carry you from now on. It doesn’t matter. Give me two taels of charity Your tavern closed for me The bullet is loaded in my heart Please tell me how I will bear all the wounds in the future and forgive me with a smile Your tavern closed for me The promise is a lie told by a child Please tell me How can I carry you in the future, have nothing to do with it, turn around, turn around, turn it into your heart, see, see, see who can light up your tavern and hit me at me. Loaded, please tell me how I will carry you from now on, and I will forgive you with a smile. The tavern closed to me. The promise is a lie told by a child. Please tell me how I will carry you from now on.
