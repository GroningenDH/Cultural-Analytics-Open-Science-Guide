Lyricist: Zhang Jianjunwei Composer: Zhang Jianjunwei Arranger: JerryC It’s dark, the lights are on, the day has passed, and the day has passed, and I’ve been traveling home in a fast way, living my life quietly, listening to songs, where is my heart floating? Close the door and return to real life. Unloaded This body is lazy and empty, living freely, neither good nor bad, it’s just a person holding on to love too deeply, I miss you more than before All these years, I forcefully smile and try to live to be a better person I believe that time will always bring Let go of something. Love is too hard to give up. I love you more than before. Talking about feelings, I have no talent. I take it too seriously. It hurts once. My life is neither good nor bad, but it’s just a person holding on to love too deeply. I miss you more than before. These years, I forcefully smile and try to live to be a better person. I believe that time will always take away something. Love is too hard Let me love you more than before, I don’t have the talent to talk about love, take it too seriously, it hurts once, I realize that there are some passers-by that I can’t forget, love is too hard, let me love you more than before, I don’t have the talent, too serious, when I talk about love I know there are some passers-by who can&#39;t be forgotten
