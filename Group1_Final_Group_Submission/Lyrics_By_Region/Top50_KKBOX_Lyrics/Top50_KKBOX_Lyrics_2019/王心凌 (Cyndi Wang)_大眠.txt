Lyricist: Shi Rencheng Composer: Zhang Jianjunwei thanked him for treating me like a fool, coaxing me to be fooled once every day, sober for the rest of my life, I don’t mind using love to get drunk, so it’s really interesting to be hypnotized. I’m happy to be a dedicated hostage. I held myself hostage and had nothing to do with him, and almost forgot how to fall in love. My wasted youth might still be able to come back to say that I feel sorry for me. I should understand that of course I will be intoxicated to the fullest. Let me accompany him to finish this love. In love, I only hope that the flower of my heart will finally bloom, and I have no other expectations. After waking up from the dream, I will clean up the wreckage. It turns out that being hypnotized is really interesting. I am happy to be a dedicated hostage. I don’t have time to explain to anyone that I held myself hostage. It’s none of his business. I almost forgot how to fall in love with a love. My wasted youth may still be able to come back to say that you love me. You should understand that of course I will be intoxicated to the fullest. Let me accompany him to the end of this love. I only hope that the flowers in my heart will finally bloom and nothing will happen. Others look forward to waking up from the dream before cleaning up the wreckage If you don’t lose your mind, where does love start? Stupid liars and fools who deceive people may forget how to fall in love for the rest of their lives. My wasted youth may still be there If you can live and say that you love me, you should know that of course I will be intoxicated to the fullest, so let me accompany him to the end of this love. I only hope that the flower in my heart will finally bloom, and I have no other expectations.
