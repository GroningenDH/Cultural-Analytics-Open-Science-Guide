Lyricist: Wu Yiwei Composer: JerryC Chasing the back that keeps disappearing in front of my eyes I can’t touch the distance without reservation I think I can move you. The gap is like heaven and earth. I like you and I like me. The chances are a few centimeters. Love is not worth it if you work hard enough Be cherished but I will never learn to give up I really want to stay by your side for the rest of my life But your pace is so fast that I can no longer catch up If I drag you down soaring May I be completely forgotten from your life I really want to monopolize You don’t share it with anyone but I’m really stupid to dim your light Don’t worry about me because I’m not good enough You have to find someone who loves you more than me Love you She walks towards you The beautiful scenery created by nature makes me so lonely and transparent I like it with all my strength The more you hurt love, I sincerely wish you happiness. I really want to stay by your side for the rest of my life, but your pace is so fast that I can no longer catch up. If I drag you down, I hope you will be completely forgotten from your life. I am true. I want to monopolize you and not share it with anyone, but I am really stupid to dim your light. Thank you for your beautiful memories. You have to find someone who loves you more than me. I like you and I like me. There is a few centimeters of error in the probability.
