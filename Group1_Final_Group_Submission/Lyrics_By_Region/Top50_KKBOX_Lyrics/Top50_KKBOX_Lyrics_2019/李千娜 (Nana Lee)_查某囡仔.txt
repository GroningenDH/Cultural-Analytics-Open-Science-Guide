Lyricist: Chen Hongyu Composer: Xiao Huangqi Arranger: You Zhenghao I have done a foolish investigation of a girl who wears Iraq&#39;s shallow kisses, like the other half of Iraq, two people, and there is nothing to rely on until the end. My thin head and hair can cover my young life, so no one can cover my life. I work hard for my life. Wo Yu is not willing to complain about suffering because my smile is my stubbornness. I cut Ruan’s long hair into a short one. The scars in my heart can&#39;t be beat when I was a teenager I said that A is such a beautiful dream, only people would believe that an invalid oath turned Ruan&#39;s short hair back to black hair, and my eighteenth heart still has hope for love. I will be the person who is destined to be destined to wear a collared bridal blouse with head hair to cover my young life. No one can cover my life. I will work hard for my life. I will not be willing to cry out to others because my smiling face is me. Ruan&#39;s stubbornness dyed Ruan&#39;s short hair back to black hair. My eighteenth heart still has hope for love. One day, I will lean on the man I&#39;m destined to wear. I cut my hair short and my mane looks at someone’s scars on my heart. When I was a teenager, I said that this is a beautiful dream. A good life is someone else’s good life. How many times does Taipei fall in winter? Ruan also becomes an adult. Some people don&#39;t want to have a job, I will wear a bridal shirt that is destined to be hung by fate
