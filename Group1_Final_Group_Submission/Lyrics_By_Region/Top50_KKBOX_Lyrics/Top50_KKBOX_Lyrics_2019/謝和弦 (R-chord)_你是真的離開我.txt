Lyricist: Xie Hexian Composer: Xie Hexian I heard from others that you are doing well and soon you will have a new life to rely on and I am still thinking about the mistakes I made when I miss you You have made a decision I thought you just said Say that our love has already come to an end, I should let you go, let you be happy, let you be free, let someone who understands you better take you away, you finally really leave, I really won’t love me anymore, I thought I could pretend not to be sad, what? My heart is broken, my heart is so painful, regretting is of no use, you have already accepted his tenderness in someone else’s arms, I heard others say that you are doing well, and soon you will have a new life to rely on, and I am still thinking about it when I miss you The mistakes I&#39;ve made You&#39;ve made a decision I thought you were just talking about our love has come to an end I should let you go Let you be happy Let you be free Let someone who understands you take you away You finally left me Really won’t love me again I thought I could pretend I wasn’t sad No matter how heartbroken my heart hurts, what’s the use of regretting You’ve already accepted his tenderness in someone else’s arms
