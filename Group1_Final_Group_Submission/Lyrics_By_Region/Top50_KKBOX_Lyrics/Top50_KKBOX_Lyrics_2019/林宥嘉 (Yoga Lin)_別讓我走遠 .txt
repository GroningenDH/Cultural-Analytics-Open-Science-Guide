Lyricist: HUSH Composer: Karencici Arranger: Zhong Chengyang / Roanni / Han Likang The whole world is rotten and rotten and has nothing to do with me This darkness is so used to me that I no longer need to look at it Don&#39;t you stay, look at me one more time, ignore my face, any tiredness, see through my weakest defenses, silence, it doesn&#39;t matter any corner, it doesn&#39;t matter, don&#39;t you stay, stay by my side, ignore the world Any crack Looking into the abyss I&#39;m in makes me feel like the light is a thread I can catch in the dark Makes me feel like the light is getting hotter and stronger in the dark Don&#39;t let me go far in the light, desperate to surround everything
