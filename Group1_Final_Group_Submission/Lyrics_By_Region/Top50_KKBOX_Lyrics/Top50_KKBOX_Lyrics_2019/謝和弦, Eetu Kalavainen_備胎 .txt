Lyricist: Xie Hexian/Eetu/Victor Composer: Xie Hexian/Eetu/Victor You said that I am more like your good friend who always listens to you telling you and his silence I said I am more like your Doraemon Your problem is better than Nobita Who is more, who broke your heart, who made a mistake and kissed someone else’s mouth, who is willing to suffer like this Sometimes I really don’t understand who is who, who is who I don’t want to know, I just want to understand Everything in your heart, do you understand, I will also hurt, but I never told you, so how much is love? You are always questioning. You are crying and talking, lying on my chest and fell asleep, so how much is love? To be a good lover, I can only secretly say ho no no no in my heart, even if you don’t know that I’m the one who sang the song, even if you don’t know that I’m the one who sang the song Always behind you Even if you don’t know that it’s me who finishes singing this song Even if you don’t know that it’s me who finishes singing this song Kissing someone else&#39;s mouth, who is willing to bear this kind of pain Sometimes I really don&#39;t understand who is who? Telling you how much love is, you always keep asking questions, you cried and said, lying on my chest and fell asleep, so how much love does it take to be a good lover, I can only secretly say ho no no no in my heart Even if you don&#39;t know that I&#39;m the one who sang the song, even if you don&#39;t know that I&#39;m the one who sang the song Even if you don&#39;t know the end of the song I am I am I am I&#39;m always by your side (Eetu Kalavainen) It&#39;s not fair My heart&#39;s on fire But I&#39;m glad to be your spare tire You don&#39;t know what I desire Wish you could promise me that I will be the one If you and your man are ever undone So there is something about love You always keep wondering You cry and talk and lie on my chest and fall asleep So there is something about love To be a good lover I can only secretly say ho no no no in my heart, even if you don’t know that I’m the one who sang the song, even if you don’t know that I’m the one who sang the song It&#39;s me that&#39;s always behind you Even if you don&#39;t know it&#39;s me that finishes the song Even if you don&#39;t know it&#39;s me that finishes the song
