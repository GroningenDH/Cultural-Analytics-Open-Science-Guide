Lyricist: Gao Erxuan OSN Composer: Gao Erxuan OSN I got on the car and my life was online I played the song and charged myself too much pressure and my shoulders are a little heavy I miss those brothers Mucha Madhouse is really too fast The world has become too strange Memories are half dead But in fact they are still Yea but it gonna make no difference Just move on to a different mood The promise of roses when I was young I regret not making the right decision I see dead roses by my feet Take the petals Bring home the fantasy that we can I&#39;ll be yours maybe you&#39;ll be mine Holding hands every day is valentines Even if the sky is about to fall I guess it&#39;s gonna be alright Just hop on my car Let&#39;s run for our lives Maybe there is no direction and no destination Even if Not alive I guess it&#39;s gonna be alright We gonna be just fine You and me I&#39;m no longer in the fairy tale world I&#39;m going to start struggling Every day and night I&#39;m too used to being strong and suppressing negative emotions How come when I grow up, condolences become stress But we gon be alright tho We gon be fine Even if you don&#39;t love me so much I love at least half of it Fighting the world I&#39;ll be your weapon and your backing When you need my encouragement I worry about you I care about you I&#39;m with you I guarantee I&#39; ll be the most caring, the most caring, the most warm, the most able to accompany you maybe I&#39;ll be yours maybe you&#39;ll be mine holding hands every day is valentines even if the sky is about to fall I guess it&#39;s gonna be alright Just hop on my car us Going to escape may have no direction and no destination Even if you don&#39;t live I guess it&#39;s gonna be alright We gonna be just fine It&#39;ll be alright And I know it&#39;ll be alright I know it&#39;ll be alright And I know it&#39;ll be alright We gonna be just fine I&#39;ll be yours maybe you&#39;ll be mine holding hands every day is valentines even if the sky is going to fall I guess it&#39;s gonna be alright Just hop on my ca r If we run for our lives, we may have no direction, no destination, even if we don’t survive I guess it’s gonna be alright We gonna be just fine I’ll be yours maybe you’ll be mine Holding hands every day is valentines Even if the sky is about to fall I guess it&#39;s gonna be alright Just hop on my car we&#39;re going to run for our lives may have no direction and no destination even if we&#39;re not alive I guess it&#39;s gonna be alright we gonna be just fine
