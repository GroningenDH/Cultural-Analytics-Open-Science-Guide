Lyricist: Eric Zhou Xingzhe/ Wu Yiwei Composer: Eric Zhou Xingzhe Arranger: Yu Jingyan&#39;s New Year&#39;s Eve fireworks line up the corners of your eyes You are the beauty that never goes out in my eyes Leaving is very good Let people understand Relying on missing and holding the smell on your body How much time is left to run Not ready to use up the last second We are fine It&#39;s a pity that we couldn&#39;t hold our love was torn away by the wind and never found again Do you dare to say to me forever Love me like the one who loves you the most I haven&#39;t changed I&#39;m still Remember the scenery along the way, the twists and turns of the road, the memories are deep in my heart, do you dare to say to me again I don’t regret your love, I say it again, we didn’t love wrong, I still remember the hot embrace, how you smiled At least I still remember no one knows How much do I remember I want to hear your tone of voice It&#39;s too late to understand Life is joking Love is really good It&#39;s too early Do you dare to say to me again Love me forever Like the one who loves you the most I haven&#39;t changed I still remember The scenery along the way, the twists and turns of the road, the memory will be deep in my heart, do you dare to say to me again, no regrets, I love me again, we did not love wrong, I still remember the hot embrace, how you smiled At least I still remember how precious our tears are It’s only after knowing that we will cry on our own. How perfect our encounter is. Do you dare to say to me again that you will always love me like the one who loves you the most? I have never changed. I still remember how hard it was to pull us hard at the moment of separation. Do you dare to say to me one more time no regrets love me say one more time we did not love wrong I still remember the heat of the hug how you smiled at least I still remember
