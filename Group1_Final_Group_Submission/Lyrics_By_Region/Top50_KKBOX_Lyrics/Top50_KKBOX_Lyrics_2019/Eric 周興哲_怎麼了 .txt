Lyricist: Eric Zhou Xingzhe Composer: Eric Zhou Xingzhe You said that blue is your favorite color You said if there is no love, so what? Did I make a mistake? The sky is gray and it’s raining. I’m staring at you and I’m gone. I can’t go back. I’m happy like before. How can I say it’s over so easily? How can I make you hug me and cry? Seeing you smile but my heart is pierced like a knife So we are all the same stubborn How can no one say anything about happiness I can no longer lead you through every step of the future What do we miss The moment we lost love I realized that you said blue is your favorite The color you said, if there is no love, then so what? You’re gone, we made an appointment, we’re happier than me, how can we say it’s over so easily, how can we make you hug me and cry too hard, we finally give blessings with all our strength, the one I love the most, the one who loves you even more, is flying, I don’t want to say that you won’t Understand please don’t pity me I’m hurt How many years do I need to be alone I don’t want to say you won’t understand please don’t pity me who said I must smile forever I don’t want to how can I say it’s over so easily how can I let you hold me Crying too hard, we end up giving blessings with all our might. My favorite can fly forever. So we are all the same stubborn. How could no one say anything about happiness. I can no longer lead you through every step of the future. What do we miss? Only when we lose love
