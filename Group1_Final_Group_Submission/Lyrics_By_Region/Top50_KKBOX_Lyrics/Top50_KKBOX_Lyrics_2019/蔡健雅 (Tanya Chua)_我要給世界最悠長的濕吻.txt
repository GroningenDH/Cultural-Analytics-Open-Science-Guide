Lyricist: Zhou Yaohui Composer: Cai Tanya opens a window and stretches out a pair of hands to float and sink and blow through a touch of wind Some intimacy has to happen Some distance makes people live more and more boring No matter how deep the cloudless sky is, it can’t compare to the depth of my longing I want to give the world&#39;s longest wet kiss Even if there is a crack in the impermanent earth, I can be complete I want to give the world&#39;s longest wet kiss Close your eyes and close your eyes You will always see the god of the moment, blinking, blinking, there will always be accidental truth Live one day, love one day, anyway, everything is possible in the past. In the future, don’t hear, don’t ask, change your soul. Sometimes it feels like we have a dream. Forget all the beautiful sacrifices. Just remember all the moving moments when you focus. Still waiting for me to give the world&#39;s longest wet kiss Swallowing the rain, I will regenerate myself but I will be complete I want to give the world&#39;s longest wet kiss Close your eyes and close your eyes, you will always see the god of the moment, blinking, blinking always I will meet by chance, live a day, love a day anyway, everything is possible in the future, don’t hear and don’t ask another soul, close your eyes, close your eyes for a moment, you can act like no one else, blink, blink, accidentally become another person live a day, love a day anyway, everything is there Maybe gentleness and violence can&#39;t change the body and soul
