Lyricist: GEM Deng Ziqi Composer: GEM Deng Ziqi When love is still brewing in the greenhouse When there is only each other&#39;s face in eyes Thinking that the future will grow like the most innocent child Once thinking that hugging my shoulders will always be by my side Time is like the most turbulent wave It&#39;s difficult for us to take an inch on the cliff but love is a wanderer who doesn&#39;t look back. If your eyes dry up, you&#39;ll sleep for a while. The flowers in the rocks will bloom and you will come back. The night will be long and the tears will flow again. Hold your hands tightly and never put them in the rocks. Stubborn, I will wait without regret Waiting is my silent confession to you Like sinking into a bottomless ocean The ebb and flow of the tide in the bustling world has nothing to do with me Stubbornness is incomprehensible bravery When the world goes through again I have been persuading me to surrender, but I have never been in despair. Missing is like a broken wing. Memories can&#39;t fly on the road. The past has imprinted you on my heart. Tonight, I&#39;m not alone. The flower in the rock will bloom and leave. You&#39;ll come back. Flow hold your hands and never let go The flower in the rock will bloom stubbornly I will wait Waiting without regret is the wildest love I have for you Wait without regret Because love waits without regret The flower in the rock will bloom and leave You will come back, the night will be long and the tears will flow again Hold your hands tightly and never let go The flowers in the rocks will bloom stubbornly I will wait Waiting without regrets is the craziest love I have for you
