Lyricist: Jolin Tsai/Mayday Ashin/Collaborative Lyrics: Chen Yiru Beauty buys jealousy You are not guilty Guilty is the world is born innocent You don&#39;t need to be sorry One day I will be you baby boy, and you gon&#39;be me If the noise doesn&#39;t stop Let me be with you Quiet I wish I could hug you, till you&#39;re really really being free Which rose has no thorns The best revenge is beauty The most beautiful bloom is a fight back Don&#39;t let anyone change you You are you or you can be someone who loves you wholeheartedly Try to imagine you switched to his body Sexuality Beware of what will hurt you How many times will you be hurt How many times will you be badly hurt Drowning Who will pull you Dreaming Who will accompany you Same shit happens every day After you leave How much ignorance and guilt can change the world You don&#39;t need to be sorry. One day I will be you baby boy, and you gon&#39;be me. If the noise doesn&#39;t stop, let me be quiet with you. I wish I could hug you, till you&#39;re really really being free which rose has no thorns the best revenge is beauty and the most beautiful bloom is counterattack don&#39;t let anyone change you you are you or you can do it someone will love you wholeheartedly A bright legend blooms in my heart We have never forgotten your accusation You have no voice but tell more truths but awaken countless sincerity
