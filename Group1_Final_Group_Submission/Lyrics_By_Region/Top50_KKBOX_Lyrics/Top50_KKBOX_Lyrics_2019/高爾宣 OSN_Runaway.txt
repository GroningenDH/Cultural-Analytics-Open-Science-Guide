Lyricist: Gao Erxuan OSN Composer: Gao Erxuan OSN Run away, run away, run away, run away I have forgotten what I am chasing No no no no no no no no no no There are too many voices in this world but I can’t hear myself Finding that having too many decisions isn&#39;t necessarily a good thing I&#39;m silently thinking She doesn&#39;t say anything She doesn&#39;t care anyway The city wall I built in pain On the wall I draw self-esteem and reality pulling the whole surface blurred How to measure I&#39;m idle smoking and sleeping every day with keys in hand But I ain&#39;t tryna get out I don&#39;t even wanna know where&#39;s my way out don&#39;t want to know I&#39;m sick and don&#39;t take medicine but I found out the day I fell in love with you Holy shit goddamn I don&#39;t go Goddamn I&#39;m used to problems that never have an answer I want to hide in the shadows but there&#39;s always someone I&#39;m looking for trouble I end up standing like a punishment Oh lord please take my satan Run away, run away, run away, run away I&#39;ve forgotten what I&#39;m chasing No no no no no no no no no no What will end this cycle Run away, run away, run away, run away I&#39;ve forgotten what I&#39;m chasing No no no no no no no no no no What should I let go to end this cycle Let&#39;s leave love aside Bread may fail if Persist in losing to the wind and the sun let me get drunk and let me lose my composure Sometimes I want to forget everything nah nah Just another dream I was trampled on again Mom I’m so tired I’m sorry you finally chose to drop out of school Am I in your heart I’ll never graduate uh Just let me fade away in this fucking dream I&#39;m fantasizing that one day you can believe that I can do it and stop being around setbacks run away, run away, run away I&#39;ve forgotten what I&#39;m chasing No no no no no no no no no no no What to leave behind to end this cycle Run away, run away, run away, run away I&#39;ve forgotten what I&#39;m chasing No no no no no no no no no no what to leave behind to end this cycle
