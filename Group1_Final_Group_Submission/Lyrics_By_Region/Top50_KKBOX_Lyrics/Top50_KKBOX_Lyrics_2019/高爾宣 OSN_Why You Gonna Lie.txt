Lyricist: Gao Erxuan OSN / Skot Suyama Tao Shan Composer: Gao Erxuan OSN Music: Skot Suyama Tao Shan Love is a very classic story that can be told many times, and you will understand it many times as you get older with time. Sometimes you want to be You see the world with your eyes and I can lock you in because you&#39;re my world Sometimes I want to murmur through your mouth Hear your tenderness To organize my thoughts I thought we wouldn&#39;t change tunes A young promise How do you get old first How do I leave paradise in an instant Nothing but rain will fall from the sky Emptiness takes your place She wanna be my Caroline But I just tell her wait in line It&#39;s me The problem is I can&#39;t let it go You&#39;re too afraid of losing to hold on to your mistakes The next one can&#39;t do anything will be more powerless It&#39;s like a vicious circle We can&#39;t respond after all So if you gonna leave me like that then Why you gonna say that and Here we go again I know but I didn&#39;t say it because I believe it But why you gonna lie like that Why you gonna break my heart Coz I believed it I believe everything you told me OK I got it Let&#39;s just ignore my pain and put aside the sacrifices You and I can all see Been going through the same situation but you gonna make it different huh? Don&#39;t talk about love, when you know it aint real Coz you don&#39;t know how I feel but don&#39;t worry I won&#39;t blame you for the rest of my life You are still the only one on this planet I don&#39;t know if I love you or hate you I don&#39;t know if I love you or hate you Maybe it&#39;s a Gemini problem I&#39;m always indecisive but I won&#39;t mention it But you know me I&#39;m just doing me Maybe tomorrow I should let you go I close my eyes I can&#39;t stop wondering Give me a way to forget you So if you gonna leave me like that then Why you gonna say that and Here we go again I know But I don&#39;t say &#39;cause I believe But why you gonna lie like that Why you gonna bre ak my heart Coz I believed it So if you gonna leave me like that then Why you gonna say that and Here we go again I know But why you gonna lie like that Why you gonna break my heart Coz I believed it I love like crazy
