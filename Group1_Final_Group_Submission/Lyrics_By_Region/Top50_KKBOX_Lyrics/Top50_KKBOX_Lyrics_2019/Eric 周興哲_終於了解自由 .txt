Lyricist: Eric Zhou Xingzhe Composer: Eric Zhou Xingzhe Arranger: Yu Jingyan The flowers in spring finally saw each other&#39;s beauty Gradually gently blown by the wind and fell in love silently This kind of bright smile makes people gradually let go of their guards You once said that you want Forever but now I can’t recover So many words stay by your side I don’t need to miss so many flowers No matter how beautiful they are, no matter how dazzling they are, they will wither eventually I finally understand that freedom isn’t all about heartbreak, then I understand that when it’s quiet, no one is waiting for you I need anyone to wait by my side I finally understand you I am the most beautiful passing by without you I am still free and easy If one day I meet you again I will smile and nod my head Bright smile will make people gradually let go of their defenses You used to be I said it would be forever, but now I can’t restore so many words to stay with you, I don’t need to miss so many flowers, no matter how beautiful they are, how dazzling they will eventually wither, I finally understand that freedom isn’t all about heartbreak, and then I understand that when it’s quiet, there’s no one I don’t need anyone to wait for me. I finally understand you. I’m the most beautiful person passing by. Without you, I’m still free and easy. If one day I meet you again, the tears I shed don’t matter. Learn to experience the embarrassment of love. It doesn&#39;t matter who is wrong and who is right. I finally understand that freedom is not all about heartbreak. It is quiet when there is no one waiting and no one is waiting for me. I finally understand you. I am still free and easy without you. If I meet you again one day, I will smile and nod.
