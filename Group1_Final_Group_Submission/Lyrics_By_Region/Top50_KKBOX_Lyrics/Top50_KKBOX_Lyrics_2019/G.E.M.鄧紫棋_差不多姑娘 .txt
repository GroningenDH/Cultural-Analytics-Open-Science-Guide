Lyricist: GEM Deng Ziqi / OA: Yao Zhongren Composer: GEM Deng Ziqi / OT: Yao Zhongren Arranger: T-Ma Ma Jingheng Similar girls chasing similar beauty Their similar desires lead their noses Direction I go back to similar homes and lie on similar sofas The blogs are almost the same, they all eat the same melons, the titles are the same, and the eights are the same. Baby with the same Gini, holding the same V, squeezing the same D, posing in the same street with the same pose, following the same trend, having the same nose, making the same boyfriend, walking the same Close, offering the same building, giving the same Rose dances the same dance, twists the butt, thinks the same way, thinks the legs are rough, looks at Facebook, people almost want to cry, girls have the same roads, are helpless, girls chase the beauty, they want the same desire They all show the same waist in the direction of the nose Fake with the same smile and the same coquettishness The same relationship with the same hugs The same thighs The same tone of coquettishness with the same method Buying the same bag and the same bravado So the speech is the same Almost all of them have almost the same narrow thoughts, almost the same aesthetics, almost the same praise, almost the same flashes, almost the same busyness, drinking the same red wine, eating the same meat, performing the same show pictures for the same scenes, almost the same grooming, almost the same skinny around them My close friends are all the same Low OH, the same sense of superiority written on the same face, walking the same red carpet at the same airport, the same make-up, the same wave skirt, the same short house, the same dirty, the same girl chasing the same beauty, they are the same Desires lead their noses in the same direction, you are the same, I am the same, she is the same stupid, listening to the same nonsense, the crows are laughing and chirping, the same blindness, the girls are all born and raised in poisonous soil, and almost all of them have been right The self in the mirror is disappointed and almost forgets the appearance of being unarmed. The symptoms of the same are exaggerated. Now, girls, I want to share that I used to be the same. I have the same sadness. I havenâ€™t eaten for two weeks. I almost died. Endless, almost, almost, almost, life really shouldn&#39;t be like this, like the song I sang, the same vanity, if you can see through the bubble of the same (innumerable, almost, the same), just the bubble of the same (innumerable, almost the same) just the same bubble
