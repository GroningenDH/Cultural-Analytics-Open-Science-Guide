Lyricist: Yi Jiayang Composer: Li Sisong&#39;s heart is very empty, the sky is big, the clouds are heavy, I hate being alone, but I can&#39;t drive away Holding her name, her joys, sorrows, sorrows, and joys How long have you walked forward? There is only one baby in my heart, and after a long time, she becomes A drop of tears froze in the left hand and became lonely Looking back, what was there? That girl told me about my dream of protecting her. She said that the world didn’t treat her so much. She gradually forgot about me, but she didn’t know that I was covered in bruises, and I never looked back for a day I loved that girl and told me that I was a thief who stole her memories and stuffed them into my mind. I don’t need freedom, I just want to carry her dream and move forward step by step. What she gives will never be heavy. There is only one baby in my heart for a long time. After she died, she turned into tears, a drop of tears solidified on her left hand, and she looked back, looking back, what was there? I never loved again for a day That girl told me that I was a thief Stealing her memories into my head I don&#39;t need freedom I just want to carry her dream forward step by step What she gave will never be heavy The girl told me that I protected her dreams, that the world didn&#39;t treat her much, she gradually forgot me, but she didn&#39;t know that I was covered in bruises, and I never loved again. The girl told me that I was a thief who stole her Memories stuffed into my mind, I don&#39;t need freedom, I just want to carry her dream and move forward step by step
