Look for the sun in a place where there is no wind, do warm sun in a place where you are cold, you are always too naive for the rest of your life, I only want you for the rest of your life. It&#39;s also you who want to take you to see the clear sky Wanli want to tell you loudly that I am fascinated by you The past is in a hurry You will always be touched for the rest of your life I only want you for the rest of your life The wind and snow are you Chunhua is you Summer rain is also you Autumn yellow is your four seasons The warmth and coldness are caused by your gaze, and the rest of your life. The wind and snow are your mediocrity, your poverty, and your glory. The gentleness in your heart is caused by your gaze. It is also your gaze.
