Lyricist: Huang Ting Composer: Ah Chao The golden ginkgo tree was in full bloom again That year The agreement under the tree has been disbanded Although the blue sky is still as clear as youth We are no longer seeing each other and living on our own No matter how much greetings often have nothing to do with happiness and only I can indulge in a moment of longing alone and tears drown the years. When will I be willing to seek reconciliation with my regrets? I have been consummated. My crushed mine can’t go back. It’s not that my heart is not dead. I still leave you a place. It’s just the name I called How can I completely disappear from the stubbornness of memories? How are you? Tell the air to listen to the futile mood. The unforgettable love only leaves the feeling that has nowhere to rest. How about me? Is there anyone who can listen? I travel with the lonely dream. I am a shadow in the sun. Respond to myself. The location is just the name I remember again Who will continue to tell the story without me in the future How are you? Tell the air to listen to the futile mood The unforgettable love only leaves the feelings that have nowhere to rest I am the shadow in the sun. Respond to me. Can anyone listen to me? Who will sympathize with me alone, waiting for the rain to pass and the sky to clear? Tomorrow&#39;s scenery Walk with me, how about I, do you care?
