Ferry, I drink this sip and forget my troubles and sorrows From now on, my life will not be so blind My buddies are all in Nine one one I can&#39;t help finding a few good friends to go out and spend money Tonight I need to have a bouncy life every day I don&#39;t have to work tomorrow, now I want to have a bouncing boo boo boo
