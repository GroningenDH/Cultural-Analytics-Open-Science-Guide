Lyricist: Lan Xiaoxie/OA: Jolin Tsai／Hayley Michelle Aitken／Johan Isac Gustafsson Composer: OC: Jolin Tsai／Hayley Michelle Aitken／Johan Isac Gustafsson Treated as a monthly doll by the person you love the most, and treated as a fat man waiting to be slaughtered by lies The happiest cloud is kicked down by a foot Do you enjoy it? Been hugged by the most caring heart and your heart is blasted by the most tender hand, hurt and ruthlessly bitten by the most precious red lips You deserve it You deserve it You can finally understand what is cause and effect You can finally learn the lesson you taught me You finally lived up to my congratulations to you Finally you also have Today Watch how flowers and butterflies turn into queen bees Watch how sheep fight back to catch animals Watch fragile tears reincarnate into King Kong&#39;s fist Is it interesting Is it interesting you finally You can understand what is cause and effect You can finally learn the lesson you taught me You finally lived up to my congratulations to you Finally you also have today You are so heart-wrenching that even a little bit of heartache interest is not enough for you and wait for the humor of fate to trickle down to you You can finally prove that there is a cause and effect in the world You can finally live the nightmare you gave me You must not disappoint my congratulations to you May you have today every year
