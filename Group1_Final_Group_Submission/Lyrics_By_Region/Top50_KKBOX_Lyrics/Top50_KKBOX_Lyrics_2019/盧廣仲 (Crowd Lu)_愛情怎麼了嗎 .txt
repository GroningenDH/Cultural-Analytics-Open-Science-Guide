Lyricist: Lu Guangzhong, Qiu Hairen Composer: Lu Guangzhong What&#39;s wrong with love? I can&#39;t wait for your hug habit, so even if I can&#39;t get an answer, what&#39;s wrong with you? Summer doesn&#39;t seem to have left. It must be because you are so cute. In the evening, the breeze blows and pulls you The hand bends in this second, the birthday wish has been fulfilled, and afterward, you fly farther and farther, leaving me alone at the original point. If time can go back, I want to go back to that day. Looking at your worry-free face, what’s wrong with love? Why can’t I speak? Faith that feels good about yourself can&#39;t you love what&#39;s wrong what&#39;s wrong with your hug habit so even if you don&#39;t get an answer love what&#39;s up with you what&#39;s up for your big sky it&#39;s a pity you forgot to look up at me what&#39;s wrong with the world what about us What&#39;s the matter? Why can&#39;t I speak? You&#39;re the faith that makes me feel good. Can&#39;t love? What&#39;s the matter?
