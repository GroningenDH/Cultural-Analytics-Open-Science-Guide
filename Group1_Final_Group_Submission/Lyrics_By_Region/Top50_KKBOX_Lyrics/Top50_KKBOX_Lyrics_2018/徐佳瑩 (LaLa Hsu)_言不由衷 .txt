Lyricist: Ai Yiliang Composer: Ai Yi&#39;s good words are not sincere and not sincere when beautiful blessings can&#39;t be closed. Love&#39;s fickleness has a beginning and an end, only a beginning and an end. Let me write a prayer for us May you always be healthy May you always know how to fly May you be true Loving someone, that person and knowing where the warmth comes from The original intention of love is cowardly, but the original intention of love remains the same. May you always be safe and healthy. May you always know how to fly. May you really love someone, that person, and know where warmth comes from. I am so strong. May I be kind forever. May I really fall in love with someone and that person. That person is not in a hurry. May you always be healthy. May you always know how to fly. May you really love someone and that person and know where warmth comes from. I am so strong. May I always be kind. May I really fall in love with someone so and so that person is not in a hurry is what the heart desires may the lost love forgive us
