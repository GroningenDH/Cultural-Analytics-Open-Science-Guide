Lyricist: Ou Mi Composer: Ou Mi Arranger: Ou Mi To put it bluntly, if you don’t contact me, it’s a test Even the regrets have been planned. There is everything that should be there, but there is no us. It’s time to wake up. I’ve been dreaming in your arms for too long. It’s time to stop. After all, I’m just a passer-by. I should leave. Fireworks will be marked off. Be polite and thankful. Persistence with fantasies is what hurts me the most. To put it bluntly, if you don’t contact me, take it as a test. If you’re tired of hearing too many lies, you’ll get tired of it. The four seasons change, there is no need to talk about what should be said, what should be done, even the regrets are planned, what should be there is all there is, but we are not there. It is time to wake up. I have been dreaming in your arms for too long. Why did the street wait for people’s hearts to change before saying nostalgia for the past? I should wake up after all. I’m just a passer-by. I should leave. Fireworks should be marked off. Be polite and thankful. Persistence with fantasy is what hurts me the most. It’s time to wake up and dream in your arms for too long It’s time to stop the clichéd plots and bad streets Why wait until people’s hearts change to say nostalgia for the past I should wake up and I’m just a passer-by after all It’s time to leave Fireworks mark off polite thanks Persistence with fantasies in your heart is what hurts you the most Persistence with illusions in your heart is what hurts you the most
