Lyricist: Ai Yiliang Composer: Ai Yiliang When the day you leave, I won’t tell stories anymore Don’t weave the succession and don’t have to worry about the ending When you leave, you won’t tell the story anymore Don’t arrange my dialogues and tell me not to I&#39;m fascinated again, so I steal the stories that make me laugh, so I steal the stories that make me sad, and I&#39;m always self-willed, proudly talking to others, and I&#39;m as happy as we walked together, and you On the day you left, all the audience left with you. Since the listeners didn’t care to listen, the speaker certainly didn’t mean to. I should apologize one by one. I shouldn’t have stolen the story. It’s because you made my story empty, and the miss made me crazy, so I put it together Someone else&#39;s sad story is pasted on someone else&#39;s happy story And I&#39;m always practicing how to say it proudly And stop being emotionally responsible for stealing &#39;Cause love is poor Apologize for my rudeness I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m sorry for my vanity I apologize I apologize I apologize Like every fable says greed has a price I have more than I can take You don&#39;t even keep the end So steal the stories that make me laugh Steal the stories that make me sad And I always Self-willed, proudly talking to others, vivid, as happy as we walked together, I apologize, I apologize, I shouldn&#39;t have stolen the story
