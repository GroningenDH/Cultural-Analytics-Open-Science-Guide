Lyricist: Lan Xiaoxie, Chen Jianning (FIR) Composer: Ah Qin (FIR) I remember the warm night sky, I remember your profile, I remember the silence, you held my hand tightly, no matter what the world will become in the future, you can not believe in eternity I don’t care about possessions, I can ignore how turbulent tomorrow will be. I just want to remember how happy I am at this moment. The wind is blowing in the distance, and the star is about to fall. Only we can see it flickering faintly, but vigorously polishing the night sky. Much like your eyes, I have a stubborn smile I want me to hold the fireworks in my heart that are about to go out, I want me to save the bravery that is about to die in my life, I want me to find a better one for you, my happiness is like a single spark, and it is enough to start a fire from now on. What can you not believe in eternity? You can ignore what you have. You can ignore how turbulent tomorrow will be. Just remember how happy I am at this moment. I have a stubborn smile in your eyes, I want me to hold the fireworks in my heart that are about to go out, I want me to save the bravery that is about to die in my life, I want me to find a better one for you, my happiness is like a spark, it is enough to start a prairie fire, and a tiny spark will burn in the future Only later can I understand what dreams are. If the starlight flickers, it’s too unpredictable. I’m willing to twinkle for you. If the rainbow eventually evaporates into gorgeous bubbles, I’d like to be the most stubborn attachment in your world. I save the dying heroism in my life, I want me to find a better one for you My happiness is like a single spark, enough to start a prairie fire From now on, only after a tiny spark burns can I understand what a dream is Oh~~~ Only after I burn this spark can I understand what is love
