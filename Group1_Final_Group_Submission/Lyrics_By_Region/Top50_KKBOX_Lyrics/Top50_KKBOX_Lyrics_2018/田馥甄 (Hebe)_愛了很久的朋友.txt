Lyricist: Lin Junfan Composer: Huang Yunling At first, I thought that what I had in the future would be enough, but then I could only imagine your future. I thought I was like a balloon chasing the wind. In the future, I can only miss the hands that released me. It’s ridiculous. Tears when love is bloody. It can be remedied, but it’s a pity that the scars on my heart can only be greeted with a smile. Fortunately, there are thousands of words, and no one is willing to express guilt. Because in the end, the most painful breakup always has a happy reason. I think it will always be far away and I don’t want to stay here. Why do you call me a young general? I thought I would change and become more understanding of love. In the end, we became friends who have loved for a long time. It’s ridiculous. Tears can heal when love is bloody. It’s a pity that the scars on my heart can only be smiled and greeted. Fortunately, there are thousands of mistakes. No one is willing to say guilt because in the end the most painful breakup always has a reason to be happy. It&#39;s ridiculous. Tears can heal when love is bloody. It&#39;s a pity that when the scars are on my heart, I can only smile and say hello. Fortunately, there are thousands of mistakes and no one is willing. Say guilt because in the end we have friends we&#39;ve loved for so long
