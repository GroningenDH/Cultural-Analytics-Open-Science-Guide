In the book, I always like to write about the overjoyed bike ride in the evening and the conversation between him and her. The girl’s white clothes. The boy loves to see her wear a lot of scenes, a lot of them are romantic, a lot of people are sad, get together and go away for a lot of days. I can’t finish the kiss just now. You like it too, right? Otherwise, why don’t you keep holding my hand? You said you really want to take me back to your hometown. The green tiles, red bricks, willows and moss are the same in the past and now. You said that you will gradually like it. You slowly get close, slowly talk about yourself, slowly walk with you, slowly I want to cooperate with you, slowly give me to you, slowly like you, slowly remember you, slowly grow old with you slowly, because slowly is a person The best reason is dessert after dinner, order what you like When you get up, you slowly like you. Slowly, slowly. Slowly talk to yourself. Slowly walk with you. Slowly. I want to cooperate with you. Slowly give me to you. Slowly like you. Slowly, slowly. Slowly grow old with you Going slowly is the best reason. In books, I always love to write until the evening when I am overjoyed.
