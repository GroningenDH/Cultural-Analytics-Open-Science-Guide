Lyricist: Yang Kaiyi Composer: Yang Kaiyi Arranger: Zhang Bolun I like your eyes, your eyelashes, your arrogance I like your dimples, the corners of your mouth, your smile I like you The whole world knows how to laugh, don&#39;t make trouble, I will continue to ask you to be ready, I like it Your shirt, your fingers, your smell, I want to be your padded jacket, your gloves, your heartbeat, I like you, the whole world understands the pain, don’t be angry with me, please wait and see I like you every moment, every second I like you here Every place, every corner of liking you has become a habit, it&#39;s hard to quit I love you so much I don&#39;t know liking you makes the rainy day clear, liking you makes the snowy day warm liking you has become a belief, it&#39;s hard to let go, how much I like you you will know I like that every moment when you play basketball shines brightly. I like that when you play the piano, every note is beautiful. I like that you accompany me to read a book and distract myself from watching me laughing at the page-turning game. I like you every moment, every second I like you everywhere I like you in every corner It has become a habit and it’s hard to quit How much I like you I don’t know I like you Make English books interesting I like you make English books interesting The math problem is easy Loving you has become a belief It&#39;s hard to let go I love you so much you will know how much I love you
