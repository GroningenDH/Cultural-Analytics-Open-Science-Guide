Lyricist: Shi Li/Chen Mei Composer: Chen Xiaoxia looked at you and she walked in front of me and said to me with a smile, “Long time no see” If it wasn’t for my fulfillment at the beginning, would I still be circling in the same place today? Don’t throw away all the sadness for the barely ridiculous dignity On the day of breaking up, love may not be forever I have only one word that I don’t regret. I will fulfill you. Today and tomorrow, I will fulfill my next summer. Don’t leave all the sorrows on the day of breaking up. It may not be forever to love someone completely. Completion is better than the entanglement of three people. The youth I have devoted to you for so many years has been exchanged for a sentence. Thank you for your fulfillment. Your chicness and adventure have fulfilled my blue sea and blue sky. I have fulfilled your today and tomorrow, and I have fulfilled my next summer. The youth I have devoted to you for so many years has been exchanged for a word of thanks. Your fulfillment has fulfilled your chicness and adventure. Sweet words, I only have one sentence that I don’t regret. I will fulfill your today and tomorrow, and I will fulfill my next summer.
