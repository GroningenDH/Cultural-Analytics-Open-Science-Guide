Lyricist: Yi Jiayang Composer: Lin Junjie, the face of the vulture in the sky for half the day, the memory of half his life hovering around the day and night line after the fifty-third day, waiting for the night to ask if the day can forgive the gray world, don’t exchange it, day and night, frozen tears, a drop of tears Very salty A postcard from the twilight It is silent, colorless, and speechless Turning over the top of the mountain to make a face with me But the night hates the day Desperately moving forward I can’t hear the rescue Destiny is too crazy Every blink of an eye is mysterious The pair of black geese in the backlight also fly past Waiting far away to say goodbye is better than saying goodbye one day The bruises under the skin seep into the blood cells The despair in the blood cells is crying out for grievances To be whipped by fifty-three days of loneliness Waiting for the dark night to ask if the day can forgive the gray world Don’t exchange day and night ice A teardrop is very salty from the postcard of twilight It is silent, colorless and speechless Turning over the top of the mountain, making a face and calling out to kiss the day in the night, thank you for the time, my eyes are red, the halo of the past, every moment is amazing, the days and nights running past It’s a lonely practice Saying goodbye is better than forgetting It’s so good to see you in mid-air It’s not noisy and there are few people but you can see those storms that are close to the sky (dark night kisses daytime) Thank you for the time that makes your eyes red The halo of past events is amazing every moment The days and nights that ran past were lonely practice Saying goodbye is better than forgetting to see today again
