Lyricist: Wu Yiwei, Zhou Xingzhe Composer: Zhou Xingzhe If the tears don’t stop after the rain If the eyes are more persistent after the sadness The pair of hands that can’t be held The love is no longer signed by anyone Like the cloud running in the sky without end If after the rain the heart is still jealous If after the sadness I’m short of temperature, I don’t want anyone to take care of you, but I can’t keep anything. We’re not over yet. I’m so unwilling to admit defeat. I just want to say that I’ve loved two people who love each other seriously. What’s wrong with two people who need to love so much? I’m deep I have loved you deeply in my heart and never left How can I give up? I just want to say that I have seriously loved two people who love each other. What is wrong with the need to love so much? I have loved you deeply. In my heart, I have never left. If you want to go, take me with you. I have not protected you well, what qualifications do I have to ask to hear you love me again, have you heard? I have become a promise with a smile on my face. I am waiting for you to start over again. Everyone is right. Everyone has loved seriously. Only in the face of fate can we understand how fragile people are. I can’t stop anyone from leaving me. I loved deeply and no one can replace me. You&#39;re in my heart You never leave If you want to go take me
