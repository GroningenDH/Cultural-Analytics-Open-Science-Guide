Lyricist: Zhang Chuqiao Composer: Hug Wu Lecheng as if we have never been together, okay? It’s too late to explain. It doesn’t matter what I have paid. I ignore myself because I can’t do anything when I meet you. It’s scary. I’m too stupid to call it love, don’t lie, just love it at all, don’t get entangled, don’t pretend to sigh, just take it as I’m too troublesome, keep hurting myself, I tell myself that’s how feelings are like, if you’re not careful, you’re too crazy to hug, and then you’ll wake up, it won’t last long Whether it’s good or bad, let’s not pursue it, let’s forget it, no matter how much I give, it’s not enough, I’m finally saved, I don’t want to make a fool of myself, there’s nothing I can do, okay? If you don’t stay and keep getting along with each other, you’ll be exhausted. You can’t say love, don’t lie, just like a little bit, but you can’t say hate. Don’t pester me, don’t pretend to sigh, just take it as I’m too troublesome, keep hurting myself, I tell myself that’s how my feelings are, how can I be careless, too crazy, don’t regret it, even if I miss it in the future, you can’t help thinking that I’m not bad, when I’m not here, will you be okay I will be sad if you are enough I am so free and easy I can’t say love don’t lie just like a little bit can’t say hate don’t bother don’t pretend to sigh understand everything forgive everything I try to find the answer and the answer is simple and simple It’s a pity because we grow up we have to get used to it as a last resort Because we grew up, we suddenly broke up when we said goodbye
