Lyricist: Wu Yiwei Composer: JerryC If there is no accidental misunderstanding at the beginning, maybe we will miss our secret base in the eternal rain. You are next to you, holding your breath. I miss you the most. I always thought that I taught you how beautiful love can be. Pushing you away, you will be lonely like a sea tide. Back and forth, no one will lead me forward bravely, but you overcome the test for me, and I finally understand that meeting you is to teach me that love is to teach me to have the courage to be loved. From hundreds of millions of hearts, waiting for a miracle, I discovered that you have already been there In my life, I can finally believe that happiness will really come. If I didnâ€™t meet you, there would be no love. The foolishness is that you took me into the sky and you made me brave. Those who are radiant and dazzling always have to wait until they lose to understand how precious those who entrusted their sincerity are. I always thought that I taught you how beautiful love can be. Pushing you away from you will be lonely like the tide. No one will lead me to move forward bravely. I overcome the test and finally understand that meeting you is to teach me that love is to teach me that I can have the courage to be loved. After hundreds of millions of hearts waited for a miracle, I discovered that you have already been in my life. Finally, I can believe that happiness will really come. If not When I met you, there would be no foolishness of love. You took me into the sky and you made me brave. Woo~ Be myself
