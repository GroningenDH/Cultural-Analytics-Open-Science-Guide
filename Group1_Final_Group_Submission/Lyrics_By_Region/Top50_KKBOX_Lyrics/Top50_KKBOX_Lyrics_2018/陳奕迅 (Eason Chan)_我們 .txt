Lyricist: Ge Dawei Composer: Chen Jianqi Arranger/Producer: Chen Jianqi Don’t say what you have to say, you just know enough The ending is perfect. Why misunderstand the story? What else can I do? Even being sad is a luxury. When I miss you, I get so close. But in the end, you can’t accompany me to a place where I can’t go back. So I’m happy, but I don’t want to. Admit that you gave me the answer when I doubted the world My biggest regret is that your regret has something to do with me No period is already perfect Why misunderstand the story What else can I do without the end of the story I have a luxury to be sad I miss you It’s so close, but after all, you can’t accompany me to a place where I can’t go back. So I’m very happy, but I don’t want to admit that you gave me the answer when I doubted the world. I feel happiness because I saw your happiness. I used to slow down time with my own hands. It’s a pity that we didn&#39;t wait for us
