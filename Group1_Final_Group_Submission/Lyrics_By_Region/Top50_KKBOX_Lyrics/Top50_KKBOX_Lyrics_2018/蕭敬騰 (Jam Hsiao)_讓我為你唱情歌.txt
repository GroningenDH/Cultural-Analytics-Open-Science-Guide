Lyricist: Ah Huo Composer: Ah Huo has the impression that you cover your face with a hat and don&#39;t say a word in the classroom. Every day, your eyes are a little lonely and you hide something. I ask you to shake your head, but your eyes are flickering. I feel the person in front of you with a hat covering your face. Corner coffee The shop wears headphones to isolate the world I hand you a cup of coffee You smiled and said thank you I know you warmed the air I met you again this time let me sing a love song for you let me say love to you please believe in my sincerity Afraid that the sky will fall, I will carry the most real fairy tale, but I just need you to give me a hug. You have a kind of lonely beauty, like amber, which is transparent but sealed in the past. The innocence of my love in the past, and now the intoxication of love, I know that you reflect the beauty. Let me meet you this time, let me sing love songs for you, let me say love to you, please believe in my sincerity, don’t be afraid of the sky falling, I will carry the most real fairy tale, just give me a hug, let me do it for you Sing a love song, let me say love to you, please believe in my sincerity, don’t be afraid of the sky falling, I will carry the most real fairy tale, just give me a hug, let me sing a love song for you, let me say love to you Please believe in my sincerity, don&#39;t be afraid of the sky falling, I will carry the most real fairy tale, just give me a hug, let me sing a love song for you, let me sing a love song for you, let me say love to you, let me love you Say love~ you~ let me sing a love song for you let me sing a love song for you let me say love to you let me say love to you
