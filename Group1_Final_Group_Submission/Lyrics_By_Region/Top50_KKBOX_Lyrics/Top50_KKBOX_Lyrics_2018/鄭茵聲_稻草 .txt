Lyricist: Lin Xinle Composer: Chen Yifen Arranger: Liao Weijie Jie Hugging at this time does not need words to interrupt time seems to be stopped for three seconds Proud you are proud of me The corners of your mouth curled up to offset all the toss and test Smile from the heart Fortunately, there is a straw Let me look back at my heartbeat before it collapses. The last straw reminds me that I will never suffer from cowardice. The last straw makes my dreams crumble. When I suddenly know that there is still a beautiful castle in my heart, no matter how big the wind and rain are, it can’t be blurred. Locked on the goal, messing around with reality is too nonsense, don’t rush back and run away, no matter how sad you cry, just throw away your bad emotions, throw away your hard work, you will be seen, happiness will come one day, I know it’s good, there’s a straw that makes me look back before it collapses My own heartbeat, the last straw is a warning, I don’t want to suffer from cowardice, the last straw makes my dream crumbling, I suddenly know that there is still a beautiful castle in my heart, no matter how big the wind and rain are, I can’t get rid of it. Before the straw collapses, let me look back at my heartbeat. The last straw reminds me that I won’t be allowed to suffer for cowardice. The last straw makes my dreams crumble. When I suddenly know that there is still a beautiful castle in my heart, no matter how big the wind and rain are. locked on target
