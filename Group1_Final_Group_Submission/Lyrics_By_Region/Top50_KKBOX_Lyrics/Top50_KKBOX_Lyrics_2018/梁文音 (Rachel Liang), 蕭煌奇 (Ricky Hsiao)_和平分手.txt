Lyricist: Huang Ting Composer: Xiao Huangqi Arranger: Lai Weizhe, Pan Xinwei, Fan Ziqian Will one day we will grow old and meet unexpectedly on the street and laugh and say that love is a farce Will one day sadness go away Every rain that has been drenched is written as an exercise From the beginning to the end where there is nothing we can do, the gap beyond love is still difficult It’s better to be guilty and accept an unintentional mistake than to bother looking for it. Breaking up with a smile. The broken one will be free with time. Regrets are hard to remedy. After waking up from the dream, maybe change to a good friend. 1250 days of happiness, learning the fish with no memory, forgetting Continue on the next journey, I’m sorry, I’m not a suitable partner, at least at the last moment, don’t let you be wronged From the beginning to the end where there is nothing you can do, the gap beyond love is still difficult to overcome, the room left for each other is full of memories, and I will return all the promises to you and give you blessings I leave you alone to walk peacefully and break up Love has nothing to ask for Nobody needs to be too guilty Accepting an unintentional mistake is better than bothering to find a way to break up with a smile The broken one will be free with time Regrets are hard to mend Wake up from the dream Maybe change another Good friends break up peacefully Love has nothing to ask for Nobody needs to be too guilty Accepting an unintentional mistake is better than bothering to find a way to break up with a smile The broken one will be free with time Regrets are hard to mend After waking up from the dream Maybe change to a good friend
