Lyricist: Xiaohan Composer: Lin Junjie A rose is surrounded by thorns Maybe it also longs to hug a dolphin There is always a smile on the face Maybe the tears are washed away by the sea Is not letting people know whether you and I are happy or difficult Good or bad The aloofness hidden in the appearance In fact, I think I want a sweet dream, I can&#39;t sleep, I can&#39;t sleep, I can&#39;t sleep, I can&#39;t sleep, I can&#39;t sleep, I can&#39;t fall down, I don&#39;t want to run, I want to see the waves you&#39;ve seen the most, I want to accompany you in your presumptuous youth, I can find the antidote in your eyes, the universe&#39;s greatness is not a coincidence Hold me~Maybe very small and I will never escape The night stars shine high-profile Maybe it’s the last burning Migratory birds can fly high high Maybe it’s a sign of wandering But who knows you and I have suffered before I defend the only pride I have In fact, I want a sweet dream, I can’t sleep, I can’t fall asleep, I can’t sleep, I don’t want to be thrown down, I can’t run, I want to see the waves you’ve seen, I want to accompany you in your presumptuous youth, I can find the antidote in your eyes. The universe’s greatness is not a coincidence. ~Hold my hand, hold me~Maybe very small, before that, I want to hold you in the crowd, understand your every tear and smile, find beauty in your story, hard work will not be in vain, love is not a coincidence, we hold hands, hold us well A hand that is so small that I will never escape hold it, no matter how small I am, I can still do it
