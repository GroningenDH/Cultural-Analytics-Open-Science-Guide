Lyricist: Gong Jiacheng Composer: Zheng Yujie used to look at the scenery of the sea here, looking forward to the future, playing the harmonica, with a carefree heart, now life here is so ridiculous, too many memories, but I can’t go back. I blame myself for the tacit understanding that is difficult to part with, but I pretend to swear that I forgot every lesson of love. Every wrinkle in my heart should be painful It’s a puzzle that can be reversed Unpredictable The distance that spreads is wrong The cherished tacit understanding along the way I blame myself I can’t bear it but I pretend to swear that I forgot every lesson of love deserves to be painful every time Every wrinkle, I will always remember the lesson of loving you Blame me for being reluctant, but pretending to swear that I forgot Every lesson of love deserves to hurt every wrinkle, I will always remember the lesson of loving you
