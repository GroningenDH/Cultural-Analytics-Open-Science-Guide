Lyricist: Chen Lingjiu Composer: Chen Lingjiu Arranger: Skot Suyama (陶山) Hey, it&#39;s love, the fault is I messed up and broke your heart, and I&#39;m always drunk, I always forget what I said, and I don&#39;t listen to you. Traveling around the world together with Qian I always look at that card casually Those commemorating the streets I walked through Tears can always light up the messy plates Today’s night I miss MY BABY too much Can you please don’t let this love turn a blind eye Oh NO OH NO I beg you to give me another chance I know I know I know the love that really breaks your heart When I finally get it But you&#39;re no longer there The tears of the response flooded back, but the answer is unsolvable I love you I love you I love you but love has changed You can’t read it back at breakfast When I’m watching a drama I’m chasing the empty double bed alone I’m thinking about it Crying alone, drunk about love, learning how to feel tired How can I hear this love song, I think of you again Until the day you shed tears, I looked in the mirror and spurned my idiot self But you are no longer by my side I&#39;m sorry I regret when you turn around me But I didn&#39;t hold your hand That day I saw you go, but I didn&#39;t hold your hand You know I won&#39;t let go of my hand easily this time But maybe it&#39;s too late It&#39;s useless You can&#39;t read back Love has gone There is no reply The concern I sent turned into unresponsive tears, but the answer is unresolved I love you, I love you, I love you, but love has changed You have read and cannot return You have read and cannot return Love has gone and never returned to me All the care I sent turned into unresponsive tears flooding back, but the answer was unsolvable I love you I love you I love you but love has changed You can’t read back The love you gave me is only blank The love you gave me how to let go
