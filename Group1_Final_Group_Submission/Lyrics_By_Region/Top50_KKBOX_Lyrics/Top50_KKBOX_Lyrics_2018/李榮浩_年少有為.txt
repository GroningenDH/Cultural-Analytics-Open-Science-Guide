Lyricist: Li Ronghao Composer: Li Ronghao Arranger: Li Ronghao The TV has been flashing and the contact information has not been deleted. You treated me well, but I destroyed it by mistake. We also wanted to have a place to sleep and eat together. How can we stay upside down day and night and can’t even make up the first payment? The wall board was smashed by me and I still haven’t repaired a bowl of hot porridge. You’re afraid I don’t have enough, so you take half of it away to describe it to you. From now on, your eyes will often turn red, so I feel sorry for me. I didn’t understand it at that time. Knowing what is precious Those beautiful dreams were not given to you, I have been ashamed in my life If I was young and learned how to advance and retreat, I would not let you suffer for me. I had a few more drinks at the wedding and your current one. I wanted a place to sleep and eat together, but what? Going to stay upside down day and night I can’t even make up the first payment I smashed the wallboard and haven’t repaired it yet You’re afraid that I don’t have enough, so you keep half of it and take it away for you to describe it as beautiful In the future, your eyes will often turn red, so you love me so much I don’t understand time If I was young and capable, I didn’t feel inferior and understood what is precious. Those beautiful dreams were not given to you. I’m ashamed all my life. When I was young, I tasted the feeling of regret because I didn’t feel inferior. I won money and status, but I really want to get it back. A few cups to wish me a promising future
