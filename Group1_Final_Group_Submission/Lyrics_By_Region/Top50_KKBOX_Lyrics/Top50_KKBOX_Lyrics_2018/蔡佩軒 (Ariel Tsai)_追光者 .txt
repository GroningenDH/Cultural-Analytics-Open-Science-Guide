Lyricist: Tang Tian Composer: Ma Jing If you are the fireworks on the sea, I am the foam of the waves. At a certain moment, your light illuminates me. If you are the distant galaxy, so dazzling that it makes people want to cry, I am chasing your eyes. Always look at the night sky when I am alone I can follow you like a shadow chasing the light Sleepwalking I can wait at this intersection No matter if you pass by or not Whenever I look up for you Even tears feel free Some love is like the sun falling down Have it and lose it If you are a firefly on a summer night and the children sing for you then I want to draw your hand Look how small I am because you have dreams and maybe you won&#39;t stay for me then Let me stand behind you I can follow behind you like a shadow chasing the light sleepwalking I can wait at this intersection no matter whether you pass by or not Whenever I lift up my head for you Even the tears feel free Some love is like heavy rain but Still believe in the rainbow I can follow behind you like a shadow chasing the light Sleepwalking I can wait at this intersection Whether you will pass or not Whenever I lift up my head for you Even the tears feel free
