Lyricist: GEM Deng Ziqi Composer: GEM Deng Ziqi／Lupo Groinig Arranger: Lupo Groinig Producer: Lupo Groinig The cherry blossom season has not yet arrived, the camera has not yet visited the restaurant, and I am still looking forward to your journey. Waiting for the sunset under the Paris Eiffel Tower I&#39;m waiting for you, I&#39;m willing to wait for the future, I have you by my side every day, I cherish every day, I&#39;m afraid I won&#39;t have time to love you well, the hour hand keeps counting down the remaining happiness we have, but the enthusiasm of embracing at this moment is always deep, the heartbeat keeps counting down life The rest of the warmth is at least loving the still black hair with you. You are not afraid of being white. After the darkness, the sun rises and tears flow. Afterwards, I persist in true love. I never give up day after day. I repeat that you are willing. The eyes that have not degenerated hold tight. Time to see you, love never stops, a landscape, new life every day, bit by bit, every day, cherish every breath, love you well, the hour hand keeps counting down the rest of our happiness, the ecstasy of embracing at this moment is always deep in the heartbeat I have been counting down the remaining warmth of my life. At least I love my black hair with all my might. If you don’t drink the coffee, it will be sour. If you don’t eat it, the dinner will be cold. Wake up before the dream comes true Whose heart is gray before it is opened The journey of chasing love is twists and turns No matter how twists and turns it is for you, it is worth every bit of it Every day, cherish every breath, love you well, the hour hand keeps counting down what is left of us Happiness, the frenzy of embracing at this moment, but it will always be deep, the heartbeat has been counting down, the remaining warmth of life is at least painful and happy, and it is only alive if you have loved. I want nothing more from you I want nothing more from you
