Lyricist: Lin Yancen &amp; Huang Yunren Composer: Huang Yunren Forget the good night every day Forget about the habit of saying good love Always think simple Tomorrow is not difficult to be afraid of embarrassing hugs Just wait for yourself to be brave but forget that tomorrow may not necessarily forget to turn around Regrets Forget who feels sad for this Remember yourself alone Ignore who is uneasy waiting so generally we all think it’s not too late but forget it will not be gone Will you remember me and love is always too late to say Will you remember me lost Only then can I understand the meaning of existence I can’t go back I’m afraid I won’t have you in the future Will you remember me I love you I forgot the list of promises I forgot we shouldn’t look around Time may not be rushed but it’s rare Waiting so generally we all think It’s not too late, but I’ve forgotten that it’s not too late Will you remember me, but love is always too late to say Will you remember me Only when you lose it will you understand the meaning of existence Remember and never go back I’m afraid there will be no more you in the future Will you remember me I love you so much This is a pity that we always understand too late Wishes and disappointments keep exchanging time Let us forget time Let us think but there is no answer Without you Will you remember me I love you
