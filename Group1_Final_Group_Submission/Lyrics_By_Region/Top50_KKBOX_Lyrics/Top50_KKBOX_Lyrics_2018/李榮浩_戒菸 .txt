Lyricist: Li Ronghao Composer: Li Ronghao has lost his edge in order to become better, and accidentally became your confidant I had a few drinks and sang a few passages, but you cried and wanted to comfort me, but I didn’t know where to stand. Listening to you and seeing you crying, my hair was wet. I was punished. I quit smoking. I’m not used to what I do without you. It took three years and a week to learn how to do it. Endure the harm you have done to me, there is not a word of blame, I quit smoking, I was infected with sadness, I don’t want you to say that the recent life is pretty happy Talking and seeing you crying and wet hair I got punished Quit smoking I am not used to what I do without you It took three years and a week to learn how to endure the hurt you gave me is not a single blame Quit smoking I don’t want to be infected with sadness I don’t want anyone, I don’t want to quit smoking, I’m not used to what I would do without you It took three years and a week to learn how to endure the harm you gave me, there’s no one word of blame I don’t want to stop smoking and be infected with sadness
