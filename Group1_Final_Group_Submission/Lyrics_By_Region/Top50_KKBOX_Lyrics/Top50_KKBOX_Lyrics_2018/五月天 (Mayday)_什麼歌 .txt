Lyricist: Ashin Composer: Ashin Have you ever asked yourself what do you have in order to have what you pay for in order to have what you can take away in the end? Since when we have a lot, it’s not like when you and I have nothing and are boring The topic is matched with the blue sky, we can all fly, as long as the wind blows, we once sang that heart-pounding song in the summer, are we still the one of you and the one of me after many years? Oops, ah, gray hair, what stays in your heart, what is it? Every song is looking for ears. Every lonely heart is still lonely. Every time you don’t understand, because of what makes every breath hurt. I seem to have lost something and healed, but I seem to have learned something After many years, maybe everything is nothing before I know what is the most important thing. We Zeng Xia la la la sang that heart-thumping song. Are we still the same you after many years? That one me? When the years slip away lightly and lightly, we all oops, we all turn gray. What stays in your heart and mine? What is that? Is it still that one of you, that one of me When the years slip away, we are all oh, oh, oh, our heads are gray, what stays in your heart, that is what we know, what is the most important until the end I have you, you have I I own you you own me I carry you you carry me I carry you you carry me
