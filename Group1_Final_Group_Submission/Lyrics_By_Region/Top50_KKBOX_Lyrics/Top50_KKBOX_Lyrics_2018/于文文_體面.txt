Lyricist: Tang Tian Composer: Yu Wenwen Arranger: Zheng Nan, don’t pile up nostalgia to make the plot bloody If it’s too late to go out, keep the dignity of the farewell. I love you, don’t regret it, and respect the end of the story. Breaking up should be decent. No one should say sorry. I owe it to me, but I dare to break my heart. In front of the camera, we are cheering and weeping, leaving hoarsely. It’s very decent to live up to the scenes of passionate love and hard work over the years. Don’t let obsession ruin it. Yesterday I loved you. The most familiar protagonist on the street has changed. Keep the dignity of farewell no matter how vigorous it is Only then did I live up to the scenes of passionate love and hard work over the years Don’t let obsession ruin it
