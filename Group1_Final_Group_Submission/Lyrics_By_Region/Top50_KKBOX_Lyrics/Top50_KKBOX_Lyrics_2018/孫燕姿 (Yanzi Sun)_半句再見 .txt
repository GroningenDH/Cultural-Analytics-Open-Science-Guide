Lyricist: Fujii Tree Composer: Li Sisong Arranger: Terence Teo A photo A half-sentence Goodbye Dust-covered memorial Review your incomplete poem with tears The forgotten oath Who has an unforgettable face Reddish eyes slightly bright sky good A memory of insomnia easily took away the time. Some of the past was too obsessed, the traces were too obvious, and the story was highlighted by regret. Why not let it go? It’s the past. Yunyan wants to forget. It’s easier to find comfort. I’m restrained by thoughts. Why don’t you let it go? It’s the past. The more you want to forget, the more you miss it. How do you say goodbye in your heart? How many years have passed? Circle is a bit too sharp in the past, whose footsteps are too far away, and the ending is regrettably written down. The more you want to forget, the more you think about it repeatedly And how do you say goodbye in your heart How many years have passed since you said this half goodbye
