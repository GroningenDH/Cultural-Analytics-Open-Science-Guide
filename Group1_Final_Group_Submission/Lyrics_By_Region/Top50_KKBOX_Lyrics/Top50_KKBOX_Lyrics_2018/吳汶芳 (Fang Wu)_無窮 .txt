Lyricist: Wu Wenfang Composer: Wu Wenfang Arranger: Oscar I know I all know that the beauty that will eventually pass away is surrounded by waves of struggle in the silent sea You know you all know how small we are Looking for loss in a moment or in eternity The unknown has agreed to the end of the world, the endless walk, hastily meet in the tangle, only in love, the faith is raised, and the heart is silent, and the heart is open. At this moment, the infinity, how much eternity, can we embrace again, in the boundless time and space, hold on to me, don&#39;t let the world fall, I know that I am all I know that the unknown is open in the wilderness, but hope is withered in the drought, how can I wake up the yearning in my heart, but you know, you all know how small we are, looking for someone waiting in the moment or eternity Believe in love, raise your heart silently and open your heart at this moment, how much eternity can embrace you again In the boundless time and space, please hold me, don&#39;t miss the end of the world, walk through the endless, rush to meet in the intricate, only in love Faith raises silently and opens up Heart is infinite at this moment How much eternity can we embrace again In the boundless time and space, please hold me and donâ€™t miss it
