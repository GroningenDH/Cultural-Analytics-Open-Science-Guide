Lyricist: Zhang Huoning/Jian Minru/Chen Yurong Composer: URU/Felipe. Z Say it&#39;s over and you speak simply When you can say it casually, stop acting and save your clumsy expressions. I&#39;ve already seen it clearly I choose to believe and wait for everything to be transparent. The truth is so ugly that I am terribly hurt. It is my persistence. Well I don&#39;t know baby, I don&#39;t know you anymore. Sometimes you can say it casually like this Even if you say something I love you Every time how can you say it so naturally Say what I love you Say anything I am willing to let time prove the failure From now on you don&#39;t need to bother you anymore You know my style I don&#39;t &#39;t play game girl Those complaints only make sense on your own I give up those demands When I didn&#39;t say to keep those angry words, I would treat it as only one person understands No one is perfect what you want from me The communication you want only picks You want to hear me, if I speak too bluntly, I’m afraid I’ll hurt you Why you always try to dominate The man you’re looking forward to doesn’t exist at all Raising a dog would be more honest than arguing ah You love that You can’t see it like this Why be patient it’s alright You said you would Give up give up give up our relationship we stop practicing and start choosing to escape You become mysterious I love you become I loved you that&#39;s how you think It&#39;s hard to want simple love Well I don&#39;t know baby Life no longer intersects yours Please ask God to come here and take everything back and say you want to end it. It’s simple. Whenever you can say it casually, you think it’s best. It’s so simple. If you think too simple, then it’s up to you to say what I love you every time oh no Oh no you say it so naturally Say what I love you Say what I&#39;m willing to let time prove yeah prove it failed Let time prove that you are the best You are the best You are the most sincere Even if you say it I ain&#39;t role model What you want from me want from me I ain&#39;t role model I ain&#39;t role model What you want from me want from me I ain&#39;t role model
