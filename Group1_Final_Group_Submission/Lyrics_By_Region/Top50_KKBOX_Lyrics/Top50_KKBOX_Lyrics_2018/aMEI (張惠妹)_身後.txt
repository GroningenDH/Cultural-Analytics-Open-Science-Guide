Lyricist: HUSH Composer: Lin Junjie I like to see you walking in front of the head like a child The first exploration of the world tells me that there are so many bright colors that you can’t change It is to walk together until the scenery fades. I will protect you behind you. You can see the sky behind the end and wait for the new life on the other side. Can you promise me when you leave? When I face your loneliness in the future, can you promise me that when we are apart, you can look back at me and let me know that I am concerned about you. After I let go, I can hold back my tears and wave goodbye to you. Remember you loved me, remember you loved me, remember you I have walked before remember to keep going forward remember I saw you stay in my eyes your figure has been stationed in my world can you promise me that you may go first when parting Can you promise me that when we are apart, you can rest assured and look back at me so that I can understand that I am worried about you. After letting go of your hand, I can wipe away the tears and wave goodbye to you. Don’t rush to promise me when I am sad. Now don’t say that you can enjoy the peace and tenderness. Can you promise me? When we meet again, don&#39;t recognize me again, don&#39;t let me bear your hand that I held, and when we meet again, it will be you waving goodbye to me
