Lyricist: Jay Chou Composer: Jay Chou I rented an apartment in the alley where you live in order to meet you by chance Why did I not study hard for three years in high school Why didn’t I get into the same university as you I found a job and left you The dormitory is very close. When I started to learn how to make omelets, I realized that you didn’t eat breakfast. You passed by again. What are you listening to in your headphones? Can you tell me that you are lying on your school’s playground watching the starry sky? The lights in the classroom are still on, remember What is the age of the love letter I wrote to you? I am still writing it. One day, one year, I will find someone silently by your side. Maybe I shouldn’t be in your world. When you receive the love letter, it also means that I am gone. Walk far away to the square next to the school, I’ll wait for the bell to ring and wait for you to finish class, let’s go together, talking and singing the song you love Crush love is not painful at all The painful thing is that you don’t even look at me I sing so distractedly but I can’t walk into you In my heart, people come and go, looking for you, guarding you, not seeking an ending, you passed by me again, I sang a confession balloon, and finally you turned around and lay on the playground of your school looking at the starry sky. What is the age of the love letter I wrote to you? I am still writing it. One day, one year, I will find someone silently by your side. Maybe I shouldn’t be in your world. When you receive a love letter, it also represents me. has gone far
