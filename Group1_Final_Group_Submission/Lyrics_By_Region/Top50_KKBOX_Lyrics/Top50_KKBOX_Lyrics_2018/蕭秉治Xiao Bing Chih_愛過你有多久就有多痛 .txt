Lyricist: Xiao Bingzhi Composer: Xiao Bingzhi made a mistake, what should I do, I can’t do it again, what should I do without your future, who can kiss you in my place, say good night, why would you suddenly let go of your hand, how would you say that you don’t love, you don’t love, it turns out that promises are only temporary Pleasure, blah, blah, rain in the middle of the night, like a icy and piercing melody, blah, blah, soaking my heart, and I can only stay here in this unrequited love, thinking of you with all my heart, my baby, how long I’ve loved you, it hurts so much As long as I&#39;ve lost you, I can only have dinner alone, I can only say goodnight to myself, I can&#39;t find the only reason to breathe I&#39;ve loved you for as long as it hurts, I can only let you go Tears are flooding, I can only be with loneliness, I can only live in my dreams, looking for your clues, memories are the most stubborn rascals, when I wake up, my thoughts are still entangled, you take away the love, only leave the hurt, avoiding is my last love, don’t say I’m sorry I deserve it, as long as you are happy, I will leave blah blah, rain in the middle of the night, like a icy-cold melody, blah blah, soaking my heart, and I can only stay here in this unrequited love, thinking of you with all my heart, my baby As long as I&#39;ve loved you, it hurts as long as I lost you. I can only have dinner alone. I can only say goodnight to myself. I can&#39;t find it anymore. The only reason I can breathe is that I&#39;ve loved you. How painful it is to lose you. As long as it is thick I can only let the tears flood I can only live with loneliness I can only live in my dreams looking for your clues Wrong what should I do what can I do Who can kiss you and say good night for me I have loved you for as long as it hurts As long as I&#39;ve lost you, I can only have dinner alone, I can only say goodnight to myself, I can&#39;t find the only reason to breathe I&#39;ve loved you for as long as it hurts, I can only let you go The flood of tears can only be accompanied by loneliness can only live in dreams looking for your clues
