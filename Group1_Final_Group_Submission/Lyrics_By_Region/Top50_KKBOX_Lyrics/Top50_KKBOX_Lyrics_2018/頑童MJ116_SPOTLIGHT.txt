Lyricist: Naughty Boy MJ116 Composer: Naughty Boy MJ116 What do you expect her to look like today? In fact, she looks good even if she doesn’t wear it. Maybe I’m afraid that I’ll lose my things. It’s best not to take risks. I’m holding my girlfriend all night and I’m asking who she is. I don’t care if she’s thin or fat. Don’t drive unsafe because I’m looking at your mother. I can’t hide you from a female star. I can’t hide you. I’m worried about being noticed by others. Feeling warm like a star Wearing Ray-Bans Her SPOTLIGHT Her beauty is only in my eyes Oops no one else will understand The spirit is tense and envious of others. She is the most beautiful scenery. At night, she lights up. Even if she is several kilometers away from me, no matter how beautiful she is, I block it as the air exudes temperament. I have to look down. He eats ice, which makes me swallow a few mouthfuls of saliva. Watching her white shoulder straps slide down makes people melt in my heart. Mona Lisa can&#39;t hide you at all. I can&#39;t hide you. I can&#39;t hide you. I can&#39;t hide you. I can&#39;t hide you. I can&#39;t hide you. I can&#39;t hide you. I&#39;m worried about being noticed by others. She went to the street and became so autumn like a star Wearing Ray-Ban feels warm Her SPOTLIGHT Her beauty is only in my eyes Alas, other people don’t know how to take her out to surprise everyone Passers-by think I’m holding a girl With her in the star, even the desert becomes the city center. How can these men’s old enemies go back to the jungle? How can I be upright? I don’t even care about work, I just want to take her around the world SHE’S OVER STUNNED UNDER SPOTLIGHT Going to the streets with her becomes a good fall like a star Wearing Ray-Ban feels warm in her SPOTLIGHT Her beauty is only in my eyes Alas, other people won’t understand 08 winky blinded by winky they were blinded by winky
