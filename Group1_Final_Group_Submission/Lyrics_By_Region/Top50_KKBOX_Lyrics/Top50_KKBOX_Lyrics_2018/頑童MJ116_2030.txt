I once said that I will not change and I will become stronger I don&#39;t think I owe anything to my younger brother I&#39;ll always be by your side I know you&#39;re only 20 Too many ambitions You think no one on this planet can stop you You laugh and I get worried Laugh I don&#39;t look like you anymore It&#39;s because now you only think about yourself This world is big, but it doesn&#39;t leave me too many gaps I used to be afraid that I also made a wrong decision to leave behind those true brothers to keep you calm WHERE&#39;S MY HOMIES AT SOUTHSIDE I NEED MY FLOW BACK You will encounter a lot of new options, you can’t imagine, in fact, many things are just illusions, you can’t, those Golden Melody awards are the role models of the old era, in fact, it’s not a big deal if you don’t win 08, I’m still on tour, remember to be grateful, remember Pray that no matter how strong a person is, his soul needs to be embraced by God and his body is taken care of. Don’t think I’m old-fashioned, that cool girl. I hope you will find it one day. Learn to fight, learn to choose, and don’t hurt others. The taller the body, the lower the barking dog It is difficult to win without attacking How to be humble SALUTE TO THE SOLDIER The biggest battle of ten years Tell your team members that we won the battle in the end but understand that there will be pain on the way and forever Don&#39;t forget you&#39;re fucking from Muzha WHAT&#39;S UP Time is too fast I want to see a big scene The room has a three-ping space Fantasy The biggest picture is a naughty boy You know everyone knows it, so how about thousands of faces in the audience I need BOY YOU WILL BE THE MAN ON TOP OF THE WORLD I TOLD YOU I&#39;M THE MAN BOY YOU WILL BE THE MAN ONE DAY Don&#39;t be afraid of those who don&#39;t Have you seen the perfect brat? After ten years of struggle, at the same time, the crowd in the audience is shouting your name. Let go of Qizai’s lazy personality and overthrow tomorrow’s shoulders. That’s right, even if you lie on your stomach, you still have to climb up the mountain and look at all those look-alike losers. Kneel for me and you will tell me now that you are right. Even if you don’t have talent, you will be harder than others. Don’t be envious. Variables make you feel disgusted Practice martial arts and overthrow them Look at your true face In the next ten years, you must explain your family. Don’t teach your children badly. Hand in hand with your brothers WORLDWIDE. I TOLD YOU I&#39;M THE MAN already said BOY YOU WILL BE THE MAN ON TOP OF THE WORLD I TOLD YOU I&#39;M THE MAN BOY YOU WILL BE THE MAN ONE DAY Don&#39;t be afraid of those imperfections, great ideals and ambitions I don&#39;t know how to protect, only think about the benefits How many people need your help to take care of You never thought about the way out, never thought about the future, didn’t think too much, so the relationship between people was cut off, and I left you. You don’t want to explain, you don’t want to do this, and you understand that you are selfish and don’t want to mess in this dye vat. Wait until you feel lonely to know where you missed it Remember the world will not turn around for you alone The first TV broadcast Your family is more moved than anyone else Remember no matter how far you fly, you have to look back and feel how the joys and sorrows of those days are related Reality fighting You braided my dreadlocks Why did I become a businessman for a few filthy money to make myself so cheap Don’t you dream of making this music underground for the rest of your life If you don’t take this step, how can you be seen You say I’ve changed I&#39;ve really changed Through all kinds of sinister Ten years of testing Perseverance is what I will Break the old rules to prove I&#39;m right As long as I live this dream I&#39;m still carrying on BOY I TOLD YOU I&#39;M THE MAN Said long ago Over BOY YOU WILL BE THE MAN ON TOP OF THE WORLD I TOLD YOU I&#39;M THE MAN BOY YOU WILL BE THE MAN ONE DAY Don&#39;t be afraid of those imperfections, time is too fast, I want to see the big scene Room Sanping The biggest photo of space fantasy is the urchin you know everyone knows how a million faces someday I will miss
