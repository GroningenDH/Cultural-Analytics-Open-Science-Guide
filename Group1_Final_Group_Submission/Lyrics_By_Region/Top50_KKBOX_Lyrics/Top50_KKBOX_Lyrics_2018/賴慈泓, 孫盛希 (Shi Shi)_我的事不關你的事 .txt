Lyricist: Lai Cihong Composer: Lai Cihong Arranger: Ge Ziyi Empty streets A heartbroken lover How can love be profound Tonight the wind is howling and clear I can fully see what I have without you Only then can I see clearly Only when I have something to give can I gain and then I can recognize clearly I am my own, you love me or not you are ironic my world stands still for a moment loving you or not loving you is all my business Whether I love you or not, it’s all my business and none of your business. Silent conversations with sad women. I’ve loved you several times. I’ve been hurt several times. Silent announcements. Only after that can I realize that I am my own. Whether you love me or not, it is a satire. My world freezes instantly. Loving you or not loving you is all my business. It has nothing to do with you. Whether you love me or not loves me Ironically, my world stands still for a moment. Loving you or not loving you is all my business and none of your business. My business is none of your business.
