Lyricist: Pan Yunan Composer: Pan Yunan Arranger: Sue Five People/Chen Junhao Lost and Loved They are all the same person Waiting for and pursuing the same encounter but no fate Looking at the phone silently The road is very calm but has no place for you The appearance is deeply imprinted in my heart I really want to forget that every night the paleness he leaves behind is an untitled sorrow like you treated honestly but in exchange for resentful dependence ran out of the door far away from your love but nothing There is nowhere to escape, wandering around, only wishing to have the same feelings, from now on, to be treated well, the lost and the loved, they are all the same person, waiting and chasing, the same encounter but no fate, looking at the mobile phone silently, the road is calm but there is no The way you look on the ground is deeply imprinted in my heart I really want to forget that every night the paleness he leaves behind is an untitled sorrow like your honest treatment but in exchange for resentful dependence and ran out of the door to stay away from you My love has nowhere to escape, wandering around, I only wish to have the same feelings, and be treated well from now on Stay away from the love for you, try my best to let go of the helplessness towards you, only wish to have the same feelings and be treated well from now on
