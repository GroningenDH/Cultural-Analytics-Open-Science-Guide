Lyricist: Firdhaus Fiddauer/ Li Kangning Composer: Firdhaus Fiddauer, God, can&#39;t you see that I love her so much, two people who are clearly in love, you want to separate them, God, you must not secretly tell her in the dead of countless nights One night someone is thinking about her future days You have to take good care of her I am not by her side You can&#39;t bully her Don&#39;t let people walk into her heart and leave her in the end because I don&#39;t want to see her cry anymore God you are I’m not secretly reading a joke, I know I’m still not capable of protecting her, let us meet, God, has she stopped insomnia recently? May the world turn into a ray of wind instead of me. Hug her, you have to take good care of her in the days to come, I’m not by her side You can&#39;t bully her Don&#39;t let people walk into her heart and leave her because I don&#39;t want to see her cry anymore I hope my hard work can catch up with her Someday I can give her a complete home But if you arrange someone else Give it to her, I will bless her God, don’t worry about me let her be happy first, God, what I said to you these nights, don’t accidentally tell her I’m afraid I’ll wake her up I still think about her at night
