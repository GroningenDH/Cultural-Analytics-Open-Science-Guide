Lyricist: Pan Yun&#39;an Composer: Pan Yun&#39;an Arranger: Tell five people Accusefive Three trips to my hometown The raindrops outside the window broke the broken glass and I met you in a pure and beautiful world, but on the day it turned bad you shed tears The exaggerated plot is enough to ask the whole world for everything you gave There is a box in your story that requires a password to commemorate the opening, but there will be puffs of white smoke, as if warning yourself not to give in. Yearning has changed since yesterday, and our love has also changed. I lost you in this city, and I lost myself by the way. Thought there was a shortcut to the absurdity and I lost you in this city Losing to my lustful self was not your excessive affection and I loved you and love couldn&#39;t sustain what I wanted to have I wanted to embrace I thought it would lead to the end of understanding of you There is a box in the story that needs a password To commemorate the moment, when you open it, there will be puffs of white smoke, as if warning yourself not to give in, yearning, the sky has changed, the world has changed, our love has changed, and I lost you in this city, and you lost yourself by the way, I thought it was absurd In the end there will be shortcuts and I lost you in this city Losing to my lustful self is not your excessive affection But I love you and love can&#39;t hold up What I want to have I want to embrace I think it will lead to the end of understanding
