Lyricist: Lin Xiaoqian Composer: Hsiao Jingteng Arranger: Xie Jiawang You walk too deliberately, even sighs are clear Too heavy meteors have fallen to the ground to bid farewell to the sky full of once ten thousand words of sorry for a sentence It’s okay like a downpour, all traces of you are wiped away Deep love It was only after I was persistent that I finally let go of my hand, I was free, I was free, but I was crying Oh, I am not perfect, I have you with me, and the broken pieces of youth also seem mature I, you, filled the gaps in my life, but left me facing the whole universe. There is no room for change. The unbroken deadlock is like a promise that has expired, and the trajectory of my heart is broken. I have loved deeply, so I am fragile and at ease. Forget about my future. Don’t belong to me Oh, the imperfect me You always waited silently for me Hiding the wounds for me Oh the never-perfect me is love Finally let me learn to accept the whole universe without you
