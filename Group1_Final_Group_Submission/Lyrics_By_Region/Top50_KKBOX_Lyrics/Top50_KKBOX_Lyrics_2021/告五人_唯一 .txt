Lyricist: Pan Yun&#39;an Composer: Pan Yun&#39;an Arranger: Tell five people that you really understand The only definition is not as simple as breathing You really hope you can clarify If you don&#39;t have heart-to-heart, how can it mean that I really love you? At the critical moment, I clearly understand your unsteadiness. Cooperate with me. When I am drifting and dying, I am sober and understand that you are behind my back. You are smart. You really understand the only definition. No one can compare your eyes, you are not sure, always clearly see your insecurity at the critical moment, cooperate with me in wandering and dying, soberly understand that you are behind my back, smart and loving, the essence is the same because there are too many people, you donâ€™t want to prove that I am your only proof i&#39;m your only one
