Lyricist: Ai Yiliang Composer: Ai Yiliang Arranger: Luo Enni, you understand, what I don’t say is the most important, those who have experienced are all worth it, stop making noise or really grow up, tell me that you say I miss you, turn around What am I still stubborn after? Can you say that my persistence is charming? Am I still worthy of being loved? I am so sad that I am not allowed to mention it to anyone. You said that I am not so dull at all. I will ignore that the world is so tolerant to me, but I don’t want it anymore. Don’t waste it. How mature I am, I can’t even pretend that I’m happy. Why can’t you listen to me? It’s just that I’m used to loneliness. The journey of two people should be completed alone. Loneliness is when I say goodbye to you slowly I cry until I am tired or I want your cheerfulness My smile is when I think of you and then when I am gone, where are you going? I want you to say that you have not forgotten me in those moments Is it still worthy of being loved once again? I am so sad that I am not allowed to mention it to anyone. You say that I am not so dull. I will ignore that the world is so tolerant to me, but I don’t want it anymore. Don’t waste any more. I can’t pretend that I’m happy. Why can’t you just listen to me? I’m just used to being lonely.
