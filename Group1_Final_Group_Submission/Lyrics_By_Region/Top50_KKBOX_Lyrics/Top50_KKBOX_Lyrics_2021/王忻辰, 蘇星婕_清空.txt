Lyricist: An Suyu Composer: An Suyu is the one I love, too stupid and too naive to regard your loneliness as a compatible soul is also my own self-indulgence, to believe you so seriously, how frivolous kisses are in the world of love, you don’t seem to understand So in the world of flowers and flowers, you should empty your heart and walk among the lies. The hazy things built up seem to be too beautiful, but also a little graceful. I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m self-confessed, it&#39;s my love, I&#39;m too stupid and too naive to think of your loneliness as a compatible soul, and I&#39;m self-inflicted, but I believe you so seriously, what a frivolous kiss I don&#39;t know if you like sunny days or rainy days, I don&#39;t remember you Taste Your hobbies Dating time I just remembered that there seems to be something I can’t meet with you Oh baby this time I’m sorry I’m too stupid and naive in love to take your loneliness as a compatible soul I’ve done it on my own to believe you so seriously A frivolous kiss, I just don’t understand I want to ignore you, but your love is like a monster that erodes people, wandering in the world like winter, but still foolishly waiting for the flowers to bloom, it’s my love that’s too stupid and naive to treat you The loneliness as a compatible soul is also my own fault I believe in you so seriously What a frivolous kiss I just don’t understand I want to ignore you Your love is like a monster that erodes people Wandering in the heart-like winter world Still foolishly waiting Blooming and blooming is my love Too stupid and too naive to regard your loneliness as a compatible soul is also my own self-inflicted to believe in you so seriously What a frivolous kiss
