Lyricist: Ah Huo/Milk Six Composer: Xiao Jingteng Arranger: Liu Pinxian Witnessed Alien Creature Rumors after the rain Give fantasy to the planet that supports you Suitable for landing Set coordinates and fly over Saha planet in a straight line I am your Solo Guitar or flute Send Amelie Dee flew over the planet Saha footprints and searched for your flesh pink meteors cut through the entire universe Breaking through the thickness of the atmosphere can’t hide the excitement The earth is too crowded with too many eyeballs I followed the lack of oxygen and flew over the planet Saha I am your Solo guitar or flute Send Amelody flies across the footprints of the planet Saha and searches for the only one that doesn’t exist in you. Hold on to the planet and become your Solo number 17N9. We will be together for a long time. ~wa~wa~wa~ Get on the space shuttle and fill up the free Rainbow and paste the planet ya~
