Lyricist: Guo Dongnan Composer: Eric Zhou Xingzhe Arranger: Yu Jingyan, do you still remember what our story agreed to become in the future? In these years, there will be moments when I think about you. I live without looking back. After leaving you, I am glad that I once had the person who came later. I must love you very deeply. Itâ€™s not like I used immaturity to bring scars. After leaving you, I was more uncomfortable than I imagined. After leaving you, I wish you happiness and freedom. I used to think that you were a lifelong fantasy world. Only when we are not disturbed, innocence is always beautiful. When we grow up, we will know that we can be innocent forever. In the end, this vow is really fulfilled, and it is lost forever. After leaving you, I held back and did not look back. The person who will have you later must love you deeply and must be more worthy of you than me. After leaving you seriously, I will feel more uncomfortable than I imagined. Resist not looking back and leave you, I am glad that I once owned you Think about it, it will be us all the time
