Lyricist: Yao Ruolong Composer: Li Shuangfei Meteor Ah, I exchanged the fall for my wish, and I was promised by God. I stopped crying and pursued what I lost. I suddenly realized what I got. The confusion along the way forced me to reflect and think about what I am most looking forward to. What kind of emotion is I willing to endure? It’s been too cold but it’s sunny, there’s always sunshine in my eyes I want to know how fallen leaves drift in the wilderness but become a garden Let withering and blooming be related Life-long regrets are all commemorative Protective shells are broken and confession makes people more intimate Wipe away tears Fantasy to welcome the other A coward who I am like me but not mine Break free from the nightmare The hand you hold is as warm as the memory It’s not missing but I forgot I want to understand rainy days survive the cold but become sunny days There is always sunshine dancing in my eyes I want to understand fallen leaves Drifting in the wilderness has become a garden, let withering and blooming be related, regrets are endless, want to understand the rainy day, survive the cold, but become a sunny day, care about each other, the most healing, tired, understand the fallen leaves, drifting in the wilderness, but become a garden, and accidental trials, who is determined to change the darkness of the world exist forever
