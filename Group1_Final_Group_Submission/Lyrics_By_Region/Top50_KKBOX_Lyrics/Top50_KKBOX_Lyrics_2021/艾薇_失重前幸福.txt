Lyricist: Adi Tsai Composer: Li Shuangfei Arranger: Lai Weizhe remembers how high you threw me Trust your embrace and show off after I flipped gorgeously Yeah Unexpectedly, we deviated by a tiny bit You didn’t catch me and fell out of the plan Ooh ooh Whose fantasy is the perfect flight? It’s like practicing the time of being in love. I only know how stupid I am when I fall heavily. One step at a time, it’s like this understanding allows us to grasp the force of the blissful free fall impact before weightlessness We didn’t calculate well We saw the target upside down ooh Whose fantasy flying is like practicing the time of falling in love I only know how stupid we are when we fall heavily The time is a little bit slower, just a bit slower, not good, beautiful mistakes hurt you, hurt me, so I learned to take care of each other ooh~ love is missing one step, just one more step to old age, it’s like this understanding let us grasp the happiness before weightlessness, you declare that no matter the scars, I will always be the most beautiful we are looking for Returning to the center of gravity and balance The time is a little bit slower Just a little bit slower A beautiful mistake hurts you and hurts me so I learn to take care of each other ooh~ Love is missing one step and one more step to old age It’s like this understanding allows us to grasp the happiness before weightlessness
