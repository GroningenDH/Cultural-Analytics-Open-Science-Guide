Lyricist: Ge Dawei Composer: Xu Jiaying Arranger: Chen Junhao Howe misses the clouds in mid-air, adjusts the time difference, looks like a little drunk, and can no longer see the expression, wants to hug, has to worry about rare things, stay at home and how long haven&#39;t you talked, don&#39;t just follow the drama and get together quickly There will be too much tomorrow Maybe you on the train are excited like a child Saluting the scenery I can’t stop laughing This scene is hard to come by Slowly asking us to wait for the hasty and perfunctory stop Don’t be in a hurry Call this me who needs to breathe The world says you should have a new pace to move forward You taught me to practice losing but I don&#39;t want to adapt yet Time is abundant I&#39;ll try to stay with you The long journey you&#39;ve planned will happen someday Only I love you It&#39;s impossible to postpone it No Other things are more important You on the train are excited like a child Saluting the scenery I can’t stop laughing This scene is hard to come by Slowly asking us to wait for the hasty and perfunctory stop Don’t be in a hurry Call this world of mine that needs to breathe Said that you should have a new pace to move forward Slowly asking us to wait for the perfunctory ones to stop, don’t be in a hurry Call this world that needs to be breathed and say that you should have a new pace to move forward Impermanence cherishes everything I’ve said it a few times, calling out to the world that needs me to be pure and say you slow down, be lazy, be more gentle
