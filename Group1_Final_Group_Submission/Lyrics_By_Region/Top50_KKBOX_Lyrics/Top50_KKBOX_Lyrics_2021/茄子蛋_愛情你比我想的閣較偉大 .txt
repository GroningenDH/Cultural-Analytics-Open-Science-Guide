Lyricist: Huang Qibin Composer: Huang Qibin Arranger: Aubergine eggs stand in the middle of the street market in my hometown, laughing and looking at the world, you are the only light in my dark heart, like the light in front of me, forgive me, this loose person, forgive me for making this Yaoshou&#39;s dream Every time you look in your eyes, your eyes vibrate, I can&#39;t tell the east from the west, I use my personality to guarantee that I will always regret that you are my lover so far, the bottom is undoubtedly the one in Sheung Shui, I really don&#39;t I donâ€™t want to leave, I blame you for walking into my life The unintentional love hurt has caused you and me to take responsibility for love Oh, love, you are bigger than I thought You gave me the last hope of this world You are my hope for the future You will understand that although the country is easy to change, but the nature is hard to change. Love you, love, white eyes, love, you are bigger than I thought, you give me the last hope of this world, you are my future. I hope you will understand that although the country is easy to change, the nature is difficult. I love you, I love you, I don&#39;t care if you know it or not, I give you all my love, I love you, I love you, I love you.
