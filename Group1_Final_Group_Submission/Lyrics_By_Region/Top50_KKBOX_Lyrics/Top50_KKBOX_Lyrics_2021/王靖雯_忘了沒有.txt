Lyricist: Xiao Ran/Zheng Zhihong Composer: Xiao Ran/Zheng Zhihong Did anyone tell you that I am not happy and I am the only one who bears it? In retrospect, I held your hand for an unknown amount of time and it has not stayed. Have you forgotten or not? Promise with you every dream every sleepless night your good night becomes lonely can only hug me in the memory you forgot have you forgotten or not without you love me is your own promise I am still fantasizing about you in the dead of night I still wonder if there is anyone who still casually mentioned what I missed, I didn’t dodge, I tried to wander around and search for all the treasures, all you forgot, did you forget, did you forget? A dream, every insomnia night, your good night turns into loneliness, you can only hug me in the memory, did you forget, did you forget, did you forget, I love you, I am your own promise I haven’t looked into your eyes how many times I want to get your response. I don’t have the courage but still want to ask you. How can you give up? Did you forget? Did you forget? Did you forget? I can only hug me in the memory, have you forgotten, have you forgotten, have you forgotten that without you, loving me is your own promise, I am still imagining that in the dead of night, you will still think about me
