Lyricist: GEM Deng Ziqi Composer: GEM Deng Ziqi Arranger: GEM Deng Ziqi Don’t be afraid of the long dark night Look up and see the stars are forming a line at this moment Maybe it’s a test to see if the scattered hearts are standing side by side at this moment When you pray and see miracles Do you believe that the answer is you You are the most ordinary but warmest angel. Fortunately, you persist in the wind and rain. Your smile with tears will one day bring the rainbow world after the rain. Because you have been moved in the pain. How many times have you bumped along the road? Even if you are afraid that you will be sad, you and I are in the same boat. You and I don’t have to back down. When you pray and see miracles, do you believe that the answer is you? A smile will one day bring a rainbow world after the rain because you are moved in the pain
