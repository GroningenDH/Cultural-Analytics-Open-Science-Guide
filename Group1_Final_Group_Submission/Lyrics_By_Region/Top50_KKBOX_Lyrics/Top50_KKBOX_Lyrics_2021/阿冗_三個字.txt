Lyricist: Wu Yuexin Composer: Jiang Xiaohui was reluctant to let go of his palms and left a lot of words to the sunset If this is not growth Tears flow unrestrainedly for whom Even if I know your current situation is good or bad, I will be seriously injured If this is not falling in love, how can I still miss it If I am Can you say three words to change the ending? The heavy rain is too capricious. You say you don’t want to continue. If we go back to the past and start calling you by your name, look at me, I think it’s my whole life. You ask me quietly. It’s not counting as a story, the palm of your hand that you can’t bear to let go of, many words are left to the sunset, if this is not counting as growing up, tears flow for whom, even knowing your current situation is good or bad, it will hurt me seriously, if this is not counting as falling in love, how can you still miss it if I say it Can these three words be changed to a different ending? The heavy rain is too willful. You say you don’t want to go on. If we go back to the past and start calling you by your name, you look at me. I think it’s a lifetime. You quietly ask me if this counts. If I say three words to the story, can it be changed to a different ending? The heavy rain is too capricious. You say you don’t want to continue. If we go back to the past and start calling you by your name, look at me, I think it’s my whole life. You ask quietly. Does this count as a story? I look at you, I think I will kiss you gently for the rest of my life. Does this count as a story?
