Lyricist: Gao Erxuan OSN / Skot Suyama Taoshan Composer: Gao Erxuan OSN / Skot Suyama Taoshan Arranger: Skot Suyama Taoshan I keep chasing dreams but I don&#39;t know what they mean I&#39;m stuck in between Till my ride comes I keep holding on to things I don&#39;t understand Tryna let go but can&#39;t (Oh no) There are too many complicated stories just flip the pages Happy ending don&#39;t belong here you don&#39;t wanna play with when I close my eyes all I see is different faces Y&#39;all create a monster but y&#39;all don&#39;t to see him ragging I used to want to be like you but everybody changes we all forget that even satan was once an angel who is a liar why me Thoughts are turning sour Feel like Melly murder on my mind I&#39;m tryna find A way to get me out But my time is running out I&#39;m tired to be the one Too lazy to force a smile In fact hand me the gun Putting it in my mouth is clearly the world is sick Why should I take medicine I can only drag my injured body consciousness trapped at the bottom of the iceberg I take a big mouthful of air but I still feel like I’m about to suffocate Then I just kept on buying When u were selling lies in Why can this sea of ​​people trust only me? I keep chasing dreams but I don&#39;t know what they mean I&#39;m stuck in between Till my ride comes I keep holding on to things I don&#39;t understand Tryna let go but can&#39;t (Oh no) eyelids are jumping I&#39; m clearing my doubts Just slow down Too many to count I&#39;m blaming myself just for fun I live on the edge I&#39;m sick in the head That&#39;s unfortunate Im thirsting for flesh I&#39;m coming for you hold on Yea you better hide Yea you better hide Yea you better run Yea you better hide Yea you better hide Imma get it done You don&#39;t want a fight I keep chasing dreams but I don&#39;t know what they mean I&#39;m stuck in between Till my ride comes I keep holding on to things I don&#39;t understand Tryna let go but can&#39;t (Oh no) I keep chasing dreams but I don&#39;t know what they mean I&#39;m stuck in between Till my ride comes I keep holding on to things I don&#39;t understand Tryna let go but can&#39;t (Oh no)
