Only by letting go can we have it again Should&#39;ve let go, mmm The joy left by the darkened wound is the bottomless vortex that has already drowned me Should&#39;ve let go, hey There is no if The words I didn&#39;t have time to say are silent forever Without you I fall apart Mmm, I fall apart, yeah, yeah Fall apart, oh,oh Fall apart Mmm, I fall apart Fall apart, oh, oh Fall apart
