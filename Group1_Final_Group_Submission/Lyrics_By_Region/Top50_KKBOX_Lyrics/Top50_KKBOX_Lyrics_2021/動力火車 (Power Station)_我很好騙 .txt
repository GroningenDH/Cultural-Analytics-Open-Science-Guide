Lyricist: Shi Rencheng Composer: Aqin (FIR) / Lu Jiahong Arranger: Huang Yuxun I can&#39;t believe that I have not been given up and you are waiting for the ending I can&#39;t describe the feeling at this moment is already hopeless Love just came please don&#39;t mind my clumsy hesitation after all I am not often I have feelings, I&#39;m easy to lie, I only need to use a few tears, and I&#39;m stuck in the nightmare I just broke out of I can’t prevent loneliness and aggression. Anyone can’t wait and spend my heart and soul. Am I so lonely that I long to be cheated? Of course I cherish you, but the more miraculous it is, the more I doubt it. I’m lucky enough to have you. I won’t lose my youth and lose my courage. There&#39;s not much left, I really doubt I&#39;ll be able to break my heart again, I&#39;m so easy to lie, just need to use a few tears to sink into the nightmare I just broke out of Love is too eager to become a dead spot All defenses can’t prevent loneliness and aggression Anyone who can’t wait and pours out their heart and soul Am I always deceiving myself I’m easy to deceive Like I’ve never been in this world I don’t know what kind of kisses you don’t Nostalgia is naive, thinking that no matter how ruthless a person is, at least there is a bottom line. I am pitiful or pathetic. I am very good at lying to you. Do you also feel this way? What kind of ending will your appearance bring me? Don’t say sorry. If I’m not immune this time, just ask for help can be lighter
