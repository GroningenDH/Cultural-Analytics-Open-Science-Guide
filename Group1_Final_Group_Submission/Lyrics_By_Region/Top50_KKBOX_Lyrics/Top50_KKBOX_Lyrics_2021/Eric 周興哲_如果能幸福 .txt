Lyricist: Eric Zhou Xingzhe/Wu Yiwei Composer: Eric Zhou Xingzhe Arranger: T-Ma Ma Jingheng Sometimes I want to go forward but I can&#39;t bear to turn my head back and run frequently When the wind is sunny and suddenly there is a storm Waiting for the next rain to pass and the sky to clear up Sometimes I We will pass through the dreams we have met before and hold them in our hands. No matter how hard we try to hold them, we will be afraid to make promises. If happiness can be like a ring and can be worn on our hands, at least the next time we are brave and injured, we will be less confused. If happiness needs to go through, we must After all the struggles, I must be strong alone and not afraid of wandering. If tears can be like a ring, they can reflect the shimmering light. Every moment is past, present, and the future will no longer hide. If happiness is really waiting for me, I will not be afraid to ask you this sentence &quot;Do you love me?&quot; Sometimes I want to go back. At the end of the memories that I can’t go back, I said to myself at the time, “If only I could be happy.” Why don’t I dare to have it now? Sometimes you will laugh at me. I hate loneliness, but I dare not love first. If I can be happy, who will be? If happiness can be like a ring, it can be worn on the hand, at least the next time you can be brave and get hurt, you can be less confused. If happiness needs to go through the necessary struggles, I must be strong alone and not afraid of wandering. If tears can be like The ring can reflect the light and flicker Every moment is the past, the present and the future will no longer hide
