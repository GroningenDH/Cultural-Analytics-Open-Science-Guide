Lyricist: Qu Ziqian/Liu Tao/Wen Ran Composer: Qu Ziqian/Liu Tao I would like to become a star guarding the buzzing of the bottom of the sea It&#39;s my dream it&#39;s magic Light up your heart To your eyes How far is the distance across the sea of ​​people Don&#39;t stop while you&#39;re still looking forward, will our love be blown to the sea by the wind and never come back? Whenever you come to me tell me the stars and the sea are far away and the light is walking with me Blooming at the dawn To your eyes How far away is it? Go through the sea of ​​people Don&#39;t stop while there&#39;s still hope Will our love be blown to the sea and never return Whenever you come to me Tell me the stars and the sea While there&#39;s still hope Will our love be blown away The wind blows to the sea and never comes back Whenever you come to me Tell me the stars and the sea Will our love be like the stars guarding the sea Never leave I come to you You are the stars and the sea My eyes are the burning stars that shine on me in the long night
