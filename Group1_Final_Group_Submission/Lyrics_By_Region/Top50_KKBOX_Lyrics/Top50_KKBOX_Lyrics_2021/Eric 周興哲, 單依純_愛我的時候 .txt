Lyricist: Eric Zhou Xingzhe Composer: Eric Zhou Xingzhe Arranger: T-Ma Ma Jingheng In the quiet night, my mind still doesn&#39;t want to stop, I still ride a bicycle and drive you into the sea, I smile and watch your fragmented memories, still grabbing my heart The first movie like tragedy I learned that at least we had this once it was my decision to make us into a beautiful memory the one who hugged you when you gave me love and the one who hugged you when I fought I won&#39;t go I won&#39;t let you go Forgive me, I am still immature, keep the words in my heart, I love you so much that I let you go, it&#39;s only my fault that I think too much, the night is too quiet, I think of you again, I miss you so much I dive into the sea with you behind my back I just want to hold you You make my world so safe Fate is still the first tragic movie I learned At least we had it Once it was my decision The decision to turn us into a beautiful memory Someone who hugged you when you gave love to me I won&#39;t leave when I quarrel I won&#39;t let go of your hand Forgive me I&#39;m still immature Keep your words in my heart I love you so much I&#39;ll let you go It&#39;s only because of what I think When you give love to me I hug you I won&#39;t leave when I quarrel with you, I won&#39;t let go of your hand, forgive me, I&#39;m still immature, keep your words in my heart, I love you too much to let you go, it&#39;s because I think too much, it&#39;s because I think too much
