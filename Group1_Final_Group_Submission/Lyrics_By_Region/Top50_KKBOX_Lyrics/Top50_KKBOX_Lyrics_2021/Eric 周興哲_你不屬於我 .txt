Lyricist: Lin Xiaoqian Composer: Eric Zhou Xingzhe Don’t say forever will make people miss it even more, like goodbye, never will, the more sad the more you see each other, the deeper the sadness Is this the rule of love? Learning to be mature doesn’t mean learning to let go, just like being willing, never being willing to love, not having to choose more No need to assume that I said I loved deeply before I understand that you don’t belong to me, I belong to my fragility, we only have today, what extravagance do we want? In the future, if you find those far-fetched reasons I didn’t hide well, I’ll practice saying that you don’t belong to me, belong to me I&#39;m really guilty, I&#39;m really willing to disappear behind you, if you find that my tears don&#39;t stop but I&#39;m waiting closely, I think I&#39;ll confess my reason for leaving. Learning to be mature doesn&#39;t mean learning to let go. No need to assume that I said I loved deeply before I understand that you don’t belong to me, I belong to my fragility, we only have today, what extravagance do we want? In the future, if you find those far-fetched reasons I didn’t hide well, I’ll practice saying that you don’t belong to me, belong to me The guilt I really want to disappear behind you If you find me tearing up but waiting tight Believe me I have my reasons I shouldn&#39;t let you bear it alone If you don&#39;t have me Can you still be strong I swear to you forever Never leave, never give up, never leave, never leave, accompany you to the end of love, you don&#39;t belong to me, belong to me, I belong to my cowardice, I really loved it, so I should let it go My guilt, I really want to disappear behind you, if you find me crying but waiting closely, I will confess to you why I love you
