Lyricist: Ge Dawei Composer: Zhang Jian Junwei Arranger: Zhang Chaoyu The white clouds have long since ceased to entangle the blue sky. The news has been intentionally broken. It’s been a few years since we saw each other again. It’s no accident. I always bring my family with me. At one point, I wanted to turn a blind eye, or I changed my mind to come closer and greeted myself. We are alive today, since we are all well, why bother to worry about who we want to worry about, we can’t be bothered about it, everyone admires us, it seems revenge Nostalgia or cry We were supposed to be a perfect couple and swore we would never see each other until we were old and dead, but we didn’t live up to our expectations and looked one more time. I can only worry about you and my children. How old are our children? I can’t get entangled, everyone praises it, it means revenge, I just want to be happy, you regret it more than me Choosing to surrender to Anwen is like a person who is locked up by longing. Throughout his life, he has repeatedly practiced forgetting. Since each is well, he has no complaints, so he can only repay with kindness now. Yesterday, he put the people around him to sleep and his memories to sleep. I shouldn’t be sad. You got what you wanted. Wuhai wants to be sensational, but what I can do is limited, I want to say sorry
