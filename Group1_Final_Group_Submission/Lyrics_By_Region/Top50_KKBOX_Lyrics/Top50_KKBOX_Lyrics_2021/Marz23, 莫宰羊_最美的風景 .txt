Lyricist: Marz23 / Mo Zaiyang Composer: Marz23 / Mo Zaiyang fell to the bottom of the valley and stretched out my hand. I still remember I came to climb after success and fame. Who the fuck are you? I&#39;m flexing cause I&#39;ve earned it No need to rely on anyone to keep doing well Shit, keep the rebellious plan I want, each one is cashing out My dictionary doesn’t have trumpet mouths, those useless haters only eat, drink, and sleep when I realize my childhood dream how many tears I shed man u never know overcome the demons Anyone can become a legend Write a unique biography for yourself With my gang Change the world Pull the trigger I feel good cause I&#39;ve been to hell I fight with the demon all night long Oh Oh Eh Eh I&#39;m at the top watching the most beautiful The road with bumpy scenery is not easy to go to hell to see the light I&#39;m in my dream yeah the most beautiful scenery I&#39;m at the top looking at the most beautiful scenery I don&#39;t have time to answer the phone first help me pull da champagne Fuck those can&#39;t kill me I&#39;m in my dream yeah The most beautiful scenery I don&#39;t know how many times I have to pack to be handsome Strong is not a flattering friend. Ignorance and ignorance may take a long time to bear. You can only watch the bonfire of unity lit in the distance. The cone hurts the heart and hurts a little bit. I know that the script will fall into a low ebb before dawn. Blaming the outside world for the noise of gongs, drums, cooking, smoke and dancing Can’t see through the fog in the flowers At the highest point you can see clearly They can’t even imagine flying higher and farther Flying ever higher and I have never been here because I can see Flying ever higher, eh eh eh da la la I&#39;m at the top looking at the most beautiful scenery The bumpy road is not easy to go to hell to see the light I&#39;m in my dream the most beautiful scenery I&#39;m at the top looking at the most beautiful scenery I don&#39;t have time to answer the phone first Pull me da champagne Fuck the things that don&#39;t kill me I&#39;m in my dream The most beautiful view I fight with the demon all night long Oh Oh Eh Eh
