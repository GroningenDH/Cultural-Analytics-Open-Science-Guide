Lyricist: Nine Knives Composer: Wei Li&#39;an/JerryC Arranger: JerryC Your voice solved the riddle of the story Falling behind a ten-thousand-year promise You under the big tree with a red scarf Holding the rain in your hands Crying and laughing Apart from you, we are still you One miss, I dare not hold your hand How lonely I will be Waiting for the red line to come If I can, I want to go back to the day I met and let time stop that rain I just want to embrace the proof that you are by my side Kiss your breath in the blink of an eye for a moment You are good, but you will never become big. You under the red scarf, the rain in your hands, cried and laughed. Except you, we are still you. If we miss you again, I dare not hold your hand. If not, if I can wait until the red line comes. I want to go back to that day when I met and let time stop that rain. I just want to embrace the proof that you are by my side and kiss your breath. In the blink of an eye, you will be forever. I wasted my luck because of you, I turned my back on fate and didn’t fear approaching. I believed in how embarrassing we were in love. I didn’t want to guard against the stormy wind. I loved it. It’s only engraved in our tearful promise. When the flowers bloom, if I can, I want to go back to the day I met and let time stop that rain. I just want to embrace the evidence that you are by my side. Kiss your breath. In the blink of an eye, leave me alone for ten thousand years. When we meet in the moonlight and turn around, that’s you The red line crosses the secret of deep reincarnation I’ve spent all my luck You’re my decision to bet on the world
