I’m really happy. I’m sorry for hurting you and hurting your feelings. I heard a voice like broken glass. I’m sorry, but I’m too self-willed. Telling the truth always makes people sad. Perhaps it shouldn’t be. Too blunt, super blunt, I&#39;m So Sorry, and I asked you Sen Qiqi to say something, and you have to bring your own silencer for fear of being sent to plant cantaloupe, and you will be educated. After eating apples, you have to cut pineapples, and you will scold me over there. Mommy, please don’t steal from me again, I’m sorry, I can’t talk to you like a panda playing the piano, I’m really stunned, I’m pissed, I’m sorry, I’m sorry for hurting you, I’m hurting your feelings. This voice is glass heartbroken I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m too willful Telling the truth always makes people sad Maybe it shouldn&#39;t be too straightforward Super straightforward I&#39;m So Sorry I made you Sen Qiqi again I&#39;m sorry I hurt you Sorry baby glass heart
