Lyricist: Mayday Ashin Composer: Mayday Ashin The crowd fireworks champagne and balloons are you who took me away from the party to escape from the whispers and commotions in the world, there are only you, me and the starry sky When did you approach me quietly When did you secretly save me Put it in my palm I bought a piece of candy Why do human beings love to look at the sky But there is a pair of wounds on their backs Is this mortal planet unworthy of being an angel&#39;s dream You gave me your wings Take me through wolves and cameras so I can taste a moment of freedom Because of you, I fell in love with that piece of sky. Under the sky, I’m praying. That’s you holding me. The deepest story, the most eternal legend, but you are me. I can live an ordinary life. Life is just a momentary moment. Cheng Shura lives in a cage of obsession with right and wrong. You help me stop the hourglass. You teach me not to be afraid of getting into trouble. It is you who make me live differently. The most profound story and the most eternal legend is that you are me. Because of you, I am able to live an ordinary life. I don’t shrink back and I don’t want to have regrets in this life. I don’t refute. I don’t want to listen to what others say. I don’t care who can understand it. No matter how big the world is But you and I use the smallest memories to form a universe Because of you, I fell in love with that sky. Under the sky, I am praying. It is you who hold me. The deepest story, the most eternal legend, but you are me, and I can live an ordinary life. Because of you, I am So I don&#39;t back down, I don&#39;t want to have regrets in this life, I don&#39;t refute, I don&#39;t listen to what others say, I don&#39;t care who can understand it, because the world is bigger than you and I piled up the universe with the smallest memories
