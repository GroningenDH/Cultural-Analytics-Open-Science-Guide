Lyricist: Wu Wenfang Composer: Wu Wenfang Arranger: Lai Weizhe I have seen a forest at the end of time. All thoughts and problems have made the heavy world fall into the bottom of the sea. When I feel powerless, I think about it~ I think about you~ Hold on to you when I lose all my focus, hold on to you, hold on to you, please leave a door for me, let me prove the meaning of existence, let me breathe for you, tell me why you want to cry, maybe because of helplessness, the stars are buried in the shady cover When I put on the fog filter, it should be clear, but the more it hangs, the more blurred it becomes. When I feel powerless, I think about you~ I think about you~ I think about you. When I lose all my focus, I hold on to you. I hold on to you. Please do it for me. Leave a door for me to prove the meaning of existence To breathe for you When I feel powerless, I think about you~ When I feel powerless, I think about you~ When I lose all my focus, I hold on to you Thinking~ thinking about you just thinking~ thinking about you When I lose all my center of gravity, I hold on to you tightly, please leave a door for me so that I can prove the meaning of existence to breathe for you
