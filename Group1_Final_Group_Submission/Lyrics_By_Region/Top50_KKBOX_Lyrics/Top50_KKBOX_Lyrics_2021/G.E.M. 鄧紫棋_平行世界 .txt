Lyricist: GEM Deng Ziqi Composer: GEM Deng Ziqi Arranger: GEM Deng Ziqi / T-Ma Ma Jingheng Lost you I forgot the sky used to be blue I couldn’t find you My eyes are hiding under the hat I’m not in love with silence but if you can’t hear why bother Who wants to wander around but if you are not at the end why my last belief is if I meet you again in a parallel world can I rewrite it with you If I meet you again can I rewrite it with you You fall from the sky like a meteor shower is beautiful Let me be caught off guard and lose you before I can make a wish If I meet you again, can I rewrite the nightmare of longing? Every day, every night, I open and close my eyes and punish me. But I try my best to fight against disappointment and not let myself be swallowed up. My last belief is that if I meet you again, I will be in a parallel world. Can I be with you My last belief is if I meet you again in a parallel world Can I rewrite my last belief with you (If I meet you again) In that parallel world (Can I rewrite it with you)
