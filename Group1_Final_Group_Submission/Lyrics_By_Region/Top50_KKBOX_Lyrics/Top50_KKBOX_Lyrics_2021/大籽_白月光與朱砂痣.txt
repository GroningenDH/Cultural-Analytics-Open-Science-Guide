Lyricist: Huang Qianqian/Wang Jiaying Composer: Huang Qianqian/Tian Guiyu Arranger: Zhao Peng/Yang Shuang The old ballads are always at the fingertips, the beauty is always in the heart As time goes on, it makes people angry. At that time, the hot heartbeat has nowhere to escape. Like a fire, it burns and burns a bridge that cannot be crossed. Time runs away in a hurry. You just remembered her good cinnabar mole, which lasts a long time, do you know that the bright moon in front of the window shines in front of the window, you look at the white moonlight alone, itâ€™s her smile when you were young, and the hot heartbeat at that time also had nowhere to escape, burning like a raging fire A bridge that can&#39;t be crossed, time runs away in a hurry, flames turn into the moon, and there are no turbulent waves, and never waver in dreams Looking at the white moonlight alone, it is her smile when you are young. The white moonlight is shining, and you only think of her good cinnabar mole. Can you know that the bright moon in front of the window shines on you? Looking at you alone, the white moonlight is your youth, it is her smile
