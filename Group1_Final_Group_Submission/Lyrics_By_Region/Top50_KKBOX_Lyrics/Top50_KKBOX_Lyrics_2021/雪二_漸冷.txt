Lyricist: Shanseling Composer: Shanseling I miss your breath I miss your words I love you, this is how I can’t forget you are my scarce oxygen without you I can’t breathe This is the distance I’m most afraid of all night I can’t close my eyes, tossed and turned over and over several times, accidentally knocked over the warm coffee cup, the plot cycle of the time of deep love, how many billions of light years, all the results are the passage of time, you are used to being on the left, that’s a certain winter, why is it getting farther and farther away Oh, I&#39;m the only one missing I miss your breath I miss what you said I love you That&#39;s how I can&#39;t forget again and again You are my scarce oxygen I can&#39;t breathe without you This is the distance I&#39;m most afraid of I can&#39;t close it all night I turned my eyes over and over several times and accidentally knocked over the warm coffee cup. How many times did the plot cycle when I was deeply in love? All the results are the passage of time. You are used to being on the left. It was a certain winter. Why is it getting further and further away? I miss you alone. I miss your breath. I miss you. I love you. I can’t forget you. You are my scarce oxygen. Without you, I can’t breathe. This is the distance I fear the most.
