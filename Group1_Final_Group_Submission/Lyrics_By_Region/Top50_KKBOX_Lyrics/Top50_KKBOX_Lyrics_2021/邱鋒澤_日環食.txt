Lyricist: Zhang Weihong/Cai Zi Composer: Zhang Weihong Cause I don&#39;t wanna go And I want you to know That I am so sorry Thinking that I used to avoid thinking about you every day There&#39;s nothing left for me There&#39;s nothing left for me The shining voice of you calling me The lens of my whole world that you know No matter where you are, you always try to capture Chang Smile and say that it will be 195 years before I meet you again, but it becomes my reason to say impermanence Run away run away run away Wanna fly away fly away away fly away But maybe I forgot All those times you chose to stay Aimless pursuit of nothing No matter what time it is, I always make up meaningless It doesn&#39;t matter I can slowly forget everything about you I thought I balanced my universe Run away run away run away Wanna fly away fly away fly away fly away But there&#39;s nothing left without you Solo I don&#39;t wanna wanna Cause I don&#39;t wanna go And I want you to know That I am so sorry Thinking of how I escaped Thinking of you every day There&#39;s nothing left for me There&#39;s nothing left for me Shining voice pretending to put it down how to step back You said that none of us will be perfect Once let the triviality of happiness wither but it doesn&#39;t matter when I hear you want me to go Run away run away run away Wanna fly away fly away fly away fly away I know you are very happy Pain don&#39;t drive me away I want you to know Cause I don&#39;t wanna go And I want you to know That I am so sorry Thinking I used to run away Thinking of you every day There&#39;s nothing left for me Cause I don&#39;t wanna go And I want you to know That I am so sorry I won&#39;t run away I think of you every day There&#39;s nothing left for me At what time will I always be meaningless to make up, it doesn’t matter, I can slowly forget everything about you I think I’ve balanced my own universe Run away run away run away Wanna fly away fly away fly away but without you there is dead silence solo I don&#39;t wanna wanna go
