Lyricist: Ruiye Composer: Guangliang finally made this decision Love really needs courage to face gossip and gossip As long as you affirm my love with a look, it is meaningful We all need courage to believe that we will be together The crowds are crowded I can feel you in my hands Your sincerity has finally made this decision What about others Say I donâ€™t care, as long as you are the same, I am sure that I am willing to go with you anywhere in the world. I know that everything is not easy. My heart has been reviewing to convince myself that I am most afraid that you will suddenly say that you want to give up on love. It really takes courage to face gossip. As long as you look at me Be sure my love is meaningful We all need courage to believe that we will be together Crowds are crowded I can feel you in my hands Your sincerity If I am strong and self-willed I will accidentally hurt you Can you remind me gently Although my heart is too anxious Afraid of missing you Love really needs courage to face gossip As long as you affirm my love is meaningful We all need courage to believe that we will be together Crowded I can feel you in my hand Your sincerity We all need courage to believe that we will be together
