Lyricist: Jiujiu Sophie Chen Composer: Jiujiu Sophie Chen / Taoshan Skot Suyama Arranger: Taoshan Skot Suyama The blue sky is filled with a kind of warm and sweet sunshine shining on my face Forget the pain and get rid of the shackles of control It used to be like this Dare to erase the sadness now if I can know everything and wait for life will become more troublesome Let&#39;s shine and wait for the bright ones to collide I&#39;m willing to let my soul wander and maybe find my way No one on the left or right can stop me from flying Let the darkness in my heart become shining Wait for the bright ones to collide I am willing to let my soul wander Maybe I can find a direction Go stop and go Watch the world and enjoy everything I don’t care about other people’s eyes here The blue sky is like a dream Open up your heart and the uneven road Say goodbye No one can stop me from flying Let the darkness in my heart become shining Wait for the bright ones to collide Willing to let our souls wander Maybe we can find a direction to enjoy everything Maybe to find the direction
