Darling! Must drink tonight Anyway, pain is tomorrow&#39;s rule is to break the too serious life how tiring My bro! My bro! It’s good to have no dreams. Youth is meant to be wasted. Rules are meant to be broken. Why should anyone say what I want? Having a style doesn’t mean being high-class Playing rock doesn’t have to be cold-hearted. I even go on variety shows to be serious. This society is too fake. Fortunately, my life is very real. It’s like I never cared that he scolded enough motorcycles Darling! Darling! Must drink tonight Anyway, pain is tomorrow&#39;s rule is to break the too serious life how tiring My bro! My bro! It’s good to have no dreams. Youth is meant to be wasted.

The ending can still be wonderful and profound Darling! Darling! I must drink tonight, as long as you are here, it is enough to continue to repeat the painful, happy and imperfect life, which is moving My bro! My bro! It’s good to have no dreams. Youth is meant to be wasted. Rules are meant to be broken. Why should anyone say what I want? How do you live a life where rules are meant to be broken? What do you say?
