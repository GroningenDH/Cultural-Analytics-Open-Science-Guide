Lyricist: GEM Deng Ziqi Composer: GEM Deng Ziqi Arranger: GEM Deng Ziqi / T-Ma Ma Jingheng Do you have superpowers Superpowers haven’t completely left Maybe it’s waiting for an ending Yeah But the story continues You acted a funny comedy to forget someone Maybe with a bit of resentment like finding out how stupid you are when I&#39;m not so innocent Could this be your only lie No way No way It&#39;s just the first time I&#39;ve found out How beautiful your lies are Do you have super powers to lie It’s unbelievable that your super power can collapse in an instant All my memories I hate you Biu Biu Biu Biu Biu Biu Biu Biu Oh I really want to replace the moon to destroy you I hate you Biu Biu Biu Biu Biu Biu Biu Biu Oh your disguise No one can beat the world Shhhhhh Shut your mouth and let the fake be true and the real be fake Your jokes I can&#39;t digest Badaboom Badaboom exploded in place You exploded until my heart broke into fireworks (My God) Let me have fun It will be your only lie Impossible Impossible This is just the first time I discovered how beautiful your lie is. Do you have the superpower to lie so that you can leave no trace? It is unbelievable that your superpower can instantly collapse all my memories. I hate you Biu Biu Biu Biu Biu Biu Biu oh I want to replace the moon to destroy you I hate you Biu Biu Biu Biu Biu Biu Biu Biu oh your disguise is unbeatable and invincible I never thought that one day I would feel like I don’t know you It’s as miraculous as the eighth wonder of the world. Super powers can only lie without leaving any traces. It’s unbelievable that your super powers can instantly collapse all my memories. I hate you Biu Biu Biu Biu Biu Biu Biu Biu super powers super powers Biu Biu Biu Biu Biu Biu Biu Biu super power super power
