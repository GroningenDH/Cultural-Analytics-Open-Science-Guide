Lyricist: Huang Weijin Composer: Qiu Fengze/Zhang Weihong Producer/Arranger: Zhang Weihong Hoong The raindrops falling outside the car window are like us, but we can&#39;t hide from the changes, facing you and I don&#39;t have a word to turn around, but tears keep falling from the hands that were once tightly held Slow love is as turbulent as it hurts. I vacuum up my heart in front of you. Every movement hides pain behind every movement. Cover the wound and let me pretend all the past with you. Letting go of all the bonds with you doesnâ€™t mean I let go Gotta get me used to carrying all the truth on my shoulders May you see the way the subtext is to stay If you can let it out on me I&#39;m willing to be a bad guy I&#39;m okay I&#39;m sorry I decided on my own Fade away Fade away fade away Your questioning is like a thread The scars of the road are calm but cannot be erased easily Some separation is not suitable for telling the truth I have to watch it let myself rot The hand that was once tightly held slowly accepts love No matter how turbulent the love is, it hurts as much as I put my heart in front of you Vacuum time will take everything Right and wrong, including pain, let me pretend all the past with you, let go of all the ties with you, let me let go, let me get used to carrying all the truth, I hope you can see this, the subtext is to stay if you are with me If you can vent on me I&#39;m okay I&#39;m okay If you still have a little nostalgia Take away all take away If you can vent on me I&#39;m okay I&#39;m okay I&#39;m sorry I decided to Fade away Fade away fade away
