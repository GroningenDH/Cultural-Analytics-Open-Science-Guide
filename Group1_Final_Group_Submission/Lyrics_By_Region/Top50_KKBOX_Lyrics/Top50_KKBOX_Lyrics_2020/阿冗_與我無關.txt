Lyricist: Zhang Zhirui/Xi Yu/House Music Composer: Xi Yu/House Music Arranger: Xu Weitian has long since become dull in the past and even started to tease himself Occasionally a sore heart caused some waves Holding a double umbrella on a rainy day passed by the favorite restaurant Quitting half of the habit Christmas without celebration Should I ask for warmth or make an excuse not to talk about Those regrets remain in my heart and become old troubles The heart-to-heart conversations that started have become dull Hope I can’t wait for your night Safety has nothing to do with me Anyway, I’m used to being alone, feeling sad and embarrassing To pretend that nature is gloomy or brilliant has nothing to do with me Anyway, I’ve long since gotten used to you being no longer alone in a blank place Pretending to let go of self-movement is sick I look back as a haze I don’t want you to pay attention and become a hindrance Woo woo I’ve long since gotten used to you being no longer in a blank place alone Woo woo The heart-felt conversation that started with pretending to be relieved has become dull and hopeless. I can’t wait for your safety at night. It has nothing to do with me. Anyway, I’m used to being alone, sad and embarrassed. I have to pretend that nature is bleak or brilliant. It’s nothing to do with me. I have nothing to do with your safety tonight Anyway, I am used to being alone, sad and embarrassed, and I have to pretend that nature is bleak or brilliant, it has nothing to do with me
