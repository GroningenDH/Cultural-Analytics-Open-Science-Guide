Lyricist: Xia Fei Composer: Pan Kefu I love you Fearless of the crowds, I have spent the rest of my life with the courage to get close to you even by a centimeter. Falling in love with you is a dangerous move I have made. I am not afraid of the changes of the years. In the future, no matter the wind and rain, it is you It’s enough to see too many lovers falling apart and falling together Love is actually very fragile like a flower in a greenhouse When you say that, I’m actually very nervous If I didn’t make a promise, would you still love me Listen to the sound of meteors falling in the night sky This wish makes you Listen, I love you, fearless of the crowds, and use up the courage of the rest of my life just to be close to you by even a centimeter.
