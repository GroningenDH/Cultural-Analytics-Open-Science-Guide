Lyricist: Fang Wenshan Composer: Jay Chou The flock of birds has left the forest The whole sky is very discouraged Butterflies are no longer attracted Roses are blooming and very quiet The wind and rain in the distance is endless The city is pale and lonely Wandering and helpless Crowds are anxious about when the sun will clear What can be destroyed in the story Only the scenery and no one can destroy our dreams The meteor next to the crescent moon streaked across the sky To whom should I explain the wish I made Meteorites travel through the vast universe The sky is full of crystals in the bright night sky My prayer finally has an answer to me I believe so much that the support behind me is that you have been walking side by side with me, looking up, waiting for the sun to rise, hearing the sound of the birds coming back, and you are the one who is waiting for me The birds have left the forest and the whole sky is discouraged Butterflies are no longer attracted Roses are blooming and quiet The distant city is pale and lonely Wandering and helpless people are anxious about when the sun will clear The only thing that can be destroyed in the story is the scenery No one can destroy us A shooting star next to the crescent moon streaks across the sky. To whom should I explain the wish I made? Meteorites travel through the vast universe. Crystals fill the sky in the bright night sky. My prayers finally have an answer. I believe so much in the support behind me. It is you who have been walking side by side with me, looking up, waiting for the sun to rise, and hearing the sound of the birds coming back. It is you who have been waiting for me. It is you who have given me firm confidence to play the dawn with both hands. It turns out that love is so beautiful (I believe so) ( The one who supports me is you who have been walking side by side with me) (Looking up and waiting for the sun to rise) Hearing the sound of the birds coming back The one who is waiting for me is you who gave me firm confidence Playing the dawn with both hands It turns out that love is so beautiful
