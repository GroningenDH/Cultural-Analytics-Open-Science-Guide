Lyricist: Eric Zhou Xingzhe/Wu Yiwei Composer: Eric Zhou Xingzhe Arranger: Freddy Haggstam When you were a child I was waiting for the palette to be filled with the colors of the universe Simple and fanatical crying is intuitive Laughter is sincere love and embraces without complexity Jealousy and speculation all these years have been bruised and bruised You donâ€™t want to admit defeat You have to make compromises You have to make a choice What did you get in the end Since when did you start not regretting arguing with the one you love Standing at odds like this Commitment Who else clings to wishes Stop starting your desire to follow I hold it in my hand, how can I lose the joy of my childhood, why what you gave and lost has become you, you must always believe in us when you were a child, and be brave when you were a child you forgot, I was waiting for the palette to be filled with the colors of the universe Pure fanaticism, crying is intuition, laughing is sincere liking, embracing without complicated jealousy and guessing, these years have not dimmed the luster in your eyes and yearning, just choose for yourself willfully to be the one and only person who still has time to start chasing love back Even if it becomes the most stubborn, the promise is worth sticking to, the desire to start again, the longing you follow is held in your hand, how can you lose the joy of childhood, why what you gave and what you lost have become you, we must always believe in our bravery when we were young write
