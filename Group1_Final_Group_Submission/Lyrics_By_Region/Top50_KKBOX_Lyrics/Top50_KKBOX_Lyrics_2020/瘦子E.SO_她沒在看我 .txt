The eyes that block you are not pierced. I think you look familiar I mean my clues are half a face is a bit general I thought you&#39;d expect us to meet I thought we&#39;d get to know more than a picture in a dream maybe you&#39;re scared to talk just a picture I left wondering if it was mine I want to see you dance I want to see your body compliment my talents Make me feel not alone You can inspire me I want to see you smile like you Your life is always spring Sweet and delicious Honey Give me your hand let me Hold me and let you feel things I never had This is the only way for you to see me Or is there a time machine to ride in 2019 She&#39;s not looking at me She&#39;s not looking at me She&#39;s half me in her heart Whenever I bow my head she&#39;s not dancing when I&#39;m sweating when I&#39;m sweating when my eyes meet his when my thoughts can&#39;t be settled Thousands of eyes staring at our relationship can&#39;t be written lightly Oh man, that picture is too far away, I remember the piece of tissue paper you handed me that day, with your phone number and your address, what do you mean, I&#39;m lying in the room thinking about the way you caress me, sorry I can&#39;t appear, he&#39;s still with you The mirror he looked at was there to record your makeup, your fat and thin, who you will meet tonight, who will accompany you every weekend, your indulgence is nothing special to me, why does he always make you bow your head and keep thinking about me? I&#39;m standing in front of you What&#39;s left in your mind In your eyes Even for a moment She&#39;s not looking at me She&#39;s not looking at me But half of me is in her heart Whenever I bow my head She&#39;s not dancing Sweat when I&#39;m sweating She&#39;s not looking at me She&#39;s not looking at me He&#39;s there recording your make-up Your fat and thin Who will you meet tonight Who will accompany you Every weekend Your indulgences are left to me It&#39;s not special Why is he Always make you bow your head and keep thinking about me Even if I’m already standing in front of you, what’s left in your mind, even if it’s just a moment in your eyes
