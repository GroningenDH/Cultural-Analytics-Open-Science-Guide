Lyricist: An Zhujian Andrew Chien Composer: Tank After turning around, heartache devours silence I want to say nothing to you We once embraced the breeze and the night sky and smiled and said that we will walk alone for a long time, memories permeate loneliness, what I want to keep the most is that I didnâ€™t keep my hands Is it still burning? Is there a melody called reluctance? There is a kind of giving up like a knife. Forgotten. Can the scars disappear? In this song, only the poetic innocence is left. There is a melody The more I miss it, the more I miss it, the more distressed it is. After wandering through, it is still profound. Thank you for smiling. I made it happen and let it go The remaining warmth of the hand, it ignites the firework, is it still shining in the eyes, there is a kind of melody called reluctance, a kind of giving up like a knife, forgetting, dusty and not fading, can the scars disappear in this song, leaving only poetic innocence and kindness The melody is called the more I miss it, the more I miss it, the more distressed it is. After wandering through, it is still profound. Thank you for smiling, fulfilling and letting go. This heartache is left behind. This is a love song that only belongs to you. Still deeply thank you for smiling and fulfilling and let go of this heartbroken love song that only belongs to you
