Lyricist: Gao Erxuan OSN Composer: Gao Erxuan OSN Arranger: Skot Suyama Taoshan Is that it? I&#39;m askin this my life I&#39;m living my dreams I finally became famous I seem to recognize happiness but I no longer recognize mirrors much I&#39;m lost, I know Still tryna find my door But I&#39;m still trying to figure out what to do My arms were cold I lost my mind my soul I need answers But I&#39;ll never get to know No name Two years have passed Now they know the name Thanks to Tao Shan Xie Hexian I looked in the mirror and no longer doubted the person inside who no longer dreamed of transforming into an ordinary person, only dark circles became darker Why? I got the most nostalgic but Feeling the most tired I should be happy especially now But I felt guilty in this fame Don&#39;t know what to do There are too many singers who deserve your attention more than me The music is on for a limited time but I don&#39;t feel relieved yet What the fuck is wrong with me? it everyone is chasing you all the news talk is all about you but other people need it more than me The circle can really be more tolerant and less misunderstood I&#39;d rather be a no name I just hope that life can be simpler Wait until that day no one will point fingers Who&#39;s the realist mothafuka breathin It&#39;s like riding a bicycle on the highway with the wind speed This fuckin path Doomed to the dead end Be sure you gotta keep your main thing Don&#39;t focus on the fame nor the pain Goddammit I don&#39;t know. Now they all hatin on me Present day I&#39;m walking lonely No w, where&#39;s your friends at? When you really need them I laugh at the past Thinking of them all as family It&#39;s funny how people see things Like fame and power mean a good mood They can&#39;t see the shadow behind the light Laughing on stage But deep down I know why there are so many Entertainers are sick As I get closer to my dreams I get closer to insomnia Paradoxical thoughts Worlds of opposites on the verge of conflict When I said I made it Yea that&#39;s great.. There&#39;s no more meaning What do I do it for? I think I need more reasons I&#39;d rather be a no name Cuz I don&#39;t rlly want no money want no fame Can be simple wait until the day no one tells who&#39;s the realist mothafuka breathin Cuz all you ain&#39;t
