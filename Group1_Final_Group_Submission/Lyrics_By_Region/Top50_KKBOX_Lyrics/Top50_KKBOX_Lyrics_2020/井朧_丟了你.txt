Lyricist: Yan Xiaonan@骑Studio Composer: Gong Yifan@骑Studio There is only breath left in the air, tears have fallen to the ground and turned into mud, I don’t see your track in my sight, try to forget the past, but the memory is too sharp, the traces of love can’t be erased after all Blowing back and forth in the cold wind, people listened so addicted to calling your name, how can I blame myself for being indecisive? Gathered courage but gave up, panicked, closed my eyes and kept running away. I always think of you every night, laughing at myself for being so stupid. I know how to cherish and lose you so easily, I will wait for you at the next intersection, and there is no news, it doesn’t matter. I meet you again, hold you tightly again, and the cold wind blows back and forth. The echo makes people listen to me so obsessively calling your name. How can I blame myself for being indecisive? Gather up the courage but give up, get flustered, close your eyes and run away again and again I always think of you every dark night and laugh at myself for being so stupid that I don’t know how to cherish and lose you so easily I will wait for you at the next intersection without hearing from you, it’s okay to meet you again Hold you tight I always think of you every dark night Laughing at myself for being so stupid I can lose you so easily I will wait for you at the next intersection without hearing from you It’s okay to meet you again Hold you tight again
