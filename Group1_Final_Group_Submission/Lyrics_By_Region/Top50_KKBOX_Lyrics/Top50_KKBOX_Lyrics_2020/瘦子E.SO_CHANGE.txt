Lyricist: Chen Yurong E.SO Composer: Chen Yurong E.SO Arranger: Black Doe I don&#39;t wanna change you baby Please don&#39;t try to change me baby We loved each other in the first place See I don &#39;t wanna change you baby Please don&#39;t try to change me baby I went around in a circle and returned to the original point, why don&#39;t you just change to someone else The air condenses and the passers-by around you turn into terracotta warriors. You once asked me what constitutes a perfect match. I haven’t told you before. The first time I met you, now I’m not sure about the change you want. Can I not be you? The picture my family wants I practice in the mirror every day where the buttons of my shirt need to be buttoned to be considered decent I&#39;m don&#39;t feel no shame I don&#39;t need any change from you I&#39;m in love with who you are you baby Please don&#39;t try to change me baby We loved each other in the first place See I don&#39;t wanna change you baby Please don&#39;t try to change me baby Why don&#39;t you just change my attitude because you just want to be you and make you cry If I just be myself I&#39;ll lose the case Two people only protect myself I can&#39;t save you I can&#39;t blame you Squeeze your neck too tight Wanna run away Your questions are like guessing lantern riddles and dare not answer casually The tasteless topic is no longer humorous as a pastime Baby it&#39;s fine it&#39;s not too bad I can get back the cooked food but the food is tasteless The topic is no longer humorous as a pastime Baby it&#39;s fine it&#39;s not too bad I can get it back I do n&#39;t wanna change you baby Please don&#39;t try to change me baby We loved each other in the first place See I don&#39;t wanna change you baby Please don&#39;t try to change me baby Go back to the original point in one lap, or change to another one
