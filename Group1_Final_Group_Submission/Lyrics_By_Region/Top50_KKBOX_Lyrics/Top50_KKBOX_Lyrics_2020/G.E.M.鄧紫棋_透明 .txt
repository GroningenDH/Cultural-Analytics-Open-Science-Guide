Lyricist: GEM Deng Ziqi Composer: GEM Deng Ziqi loves you and also loves me This is a kind of torture This is a kind of torture Countless street lights accompany me along the road tonight but illuminate the cracks in my loneliness even more If this is a dream, it is destined to have no result Just let it be a dream and wake up to be relieved whether the moonlight is too sensational and I suddenly become emotional I am alone but it is difficult to be quiet I open my eyes and our way cannot be seen clearly I want to close my eyes and stop everything When my world appears You appear You and I look at myself become transparent become transparent blame me too obsessed with you makes me not like myself in the lonely night of missing you in the lonely night I want to become transparent become transparent want to forget you completely me My heart is occupied by you It feels like I met you like a sheep meets a lion I wander between loving you or loving myself A cross Wearing a mask when I should be naked I speak to you words I don&#39;t understand You are the sun How dim is my starlight You are the ocean Your frivolity I can&#39;t resist I&#39;m getting better at lying to myself I want your blooms just bury me My world appeared You appeared You I watched myself become transparent It’s because I’m too obsessed with you that I don’t feel like myself. In the lonely night when I miss you, I want to be transparent and transparent. I want to forget you completely, but my heart is occupied by you. I love you too. Loving me is a kind of torment This is a kind of torment Loving you is to forget me This is a kind of torment This is a kind of torment When my world appeared and you appeared, I saw myself become transparent, blame me for being transparent You are so obsessed that I don’t feel like myself. In the lonely night when I miss you, in the lonely night, I want to make myself transparent and transparent, I want to forget you completely, but my heart is occupied by you. Loving you is a kind of torture. grind
