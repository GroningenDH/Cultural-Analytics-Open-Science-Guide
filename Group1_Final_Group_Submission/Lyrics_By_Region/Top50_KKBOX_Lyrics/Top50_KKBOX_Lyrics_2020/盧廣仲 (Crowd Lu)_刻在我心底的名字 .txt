Lyricist: Xu Yuanting/Jia Wang/Chen Wenhua Composer: Xu Yuanting/Jia Wang/Chen Wenhua Production/Arrangement: Huang Yuxun Oublie-le (French: Forget You) I told myself that the more I try to catch up with the light, the more I can’t get away from the shadow Je t&#39;aimais (French: I love you) I am the only one who will never forget that I am the only one who finally surrendered the courage of my heart Your silent response is the name engraved in my heart with kindness I forgot about the time, so I told a lie once, and I was stubborn with the world all my life Perseverance feels that even breathing is a luxury If there is a next time, I will love again The name engraved in my heart You are hidden in a dusty place If it weren&#39;t for this, how would I live my life I live in a city of neon lights I hold the address that flies to heaven You I can soar, but I can only stop looking for you In the vast sea of ​​people, I still think of you You finally left the track of missing Memories connect me to the past The name engraved in my heart I forgot the time Since I decided to fall in love once, I hope for the rest of my life This world is still and missing is not a luxury If there is a next time, I will love again The name engraved in my heart You are hidden in a dusty place If it weren&#39;t like this, how would I live my whole life? I live in the city that misses you Holding my hand and flying to the sky You keep flying and I hold on for you The name engraved in my heart I forgot about time Since I decided to fall in love once, I hope for the rest of my life that this world will be still and miss it so that it won’t be a luxury If there is a next time, I will love again once
