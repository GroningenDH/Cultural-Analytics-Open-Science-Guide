Lyricist: Wei Li&#39;an WeiBird / Holly Lou Luo Weizhen / Qing Shi Shu / Yao Shuhuan (Yao Tou) / Cai Zhouhan Composer: Wei Li&#39;an WeiBird / Holly Lou Luo Weizhen / Qing Shi Shu / Yao Shuhuan (Yao Tou) / Cai Zhouhan Wei Li&#39;an WeiBird You said never to see me in front of you again You said never to see me waiting in front of your house again I said Since I am by your side right now, can&#39;t you give me a word of goodbye The blue sky suddenly turns cloudy and covers you Tears gathered on the face of the raindrops The kite broke the string Memories are still on the cliff and still swinging with me And the moment you turned away trembling Your shoulders The scene of parting we repeat it again and again But this time it’s not like before What to do You said never to see it again I&#39;m in front of you and you say never again I&#39;m waiting in front of your house and I say since I&#39;m by your side right now can&#39;t you give me a word goodbye You say never see me in front of you again You say never again I&#39;m waiting in front of your house Even if we&#39;ve had each other for so many years Isn&#39;t it worth saying goodbye Goodbye... The memory is still on the edge of the cliff Still swinging with me And the moment you turned away shaking your shoulders We repeat it again and again But this time it&#39;s not like What did you do in the past? You said never to see me in front of you again. You said never to see me waiting in front of your house. I said, since I am by your side right now, can’t you give me a word of goodbye? You said never to see me again. Until I&#39;m in front of you and you say never again I&#39;ll wait in front of your house Even though we&#39;ve had each other for so many years Isn&#39;t it worth it for you to say a good goodbye Go back to the old picture of you and me We repeat it again and again We repeat it again and again I want to go back In the past, we repeated the past that we can’t go back to. You said never to see me in front of you again. You said never to see me waiting in front of your house again. Goodbye You say never see me in front of you You say never again I&#39;m waiting at your door Even if we&#39;ve had each other for so many years Isn&#39;t it worth it You say goodbye Never don&#39;t don&#39;t say goodbye Don&#39;t don&#39;t don&#39;t say goodbye say goodbye no no no no no no no never
