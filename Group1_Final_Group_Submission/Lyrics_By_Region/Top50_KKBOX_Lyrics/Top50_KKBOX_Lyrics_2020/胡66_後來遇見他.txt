Lyricist: Li Yihao Composer: Li Yihao Hey, do you still think of me like I sometimes cry at night, when I’m full of joy, I think you are the end, so I give you all the time, I’m always disobedient, I miss you and I start pretending to be stupid, repeating you Say that, forget it, let’s stop struggling, it’s useless, I can’t hear from you from now on, I’m afraid I can’t control myself thinking about you, I met him later, he will accompany me in spring, autumn, winter and summer to heal my scars, maybe I will always be happy, the girl by your side Does it make you happy like me? There are too many things I want to say to you. Time is always disobedient. Missing also starts to pretend to be stupid. You say, let’s forget it, let’s stop struggling. It’s useless. From now on, I can’t hear you The news is that I’m afraid I can’t control myself and think about you. Later, I met him and accompanied me to heal my scars in spring, autumn, winter and summer. Maybe I’ll always be happy, right? Does she beside you make you happy like me? There are so many things I want to say to you, and I met later He accompanies me in spring, autumn, winter and summer to heal my scars, maybe I will always be happy
