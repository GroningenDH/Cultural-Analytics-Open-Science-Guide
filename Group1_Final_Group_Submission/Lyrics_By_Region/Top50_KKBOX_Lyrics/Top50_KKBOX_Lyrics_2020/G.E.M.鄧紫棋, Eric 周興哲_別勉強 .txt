Lyricist: GEM Deng Ziqi Composer: GEM Deng Ziqi It doesn’t matter who falls in love first, don’t pursue whoever gives up first, and whoever falls in love with each other in the end The hedgehog, the more we hug each other, the more heartbroken we can only blame that we are not a natural couple, at least it proves how much we love It’s pure love that makes you love each other till it’s full of scars. It turns out that memories are so beautiful, but a misunderstanding just let it go and never come back. Don’t force yourself to go to a distant place that you can’t reach. You know I&#39;m so strong and lonely Sooner or later I&#39;ll get used to this song of ours We can&#39;t finish singing so don&#39;t force us to be young Let&#39;s treat the streetlights like the moon and celebrate our romantic dreams naively But the dawn is too free to imagine Let us both Don’t force yourself to go to a place you can’t reach. Love is not to be strong on promises. You’re tired and you’re crying late at night and you’re still awake. The piano that is out of tune is still familiar to my ears, but I really want to ignore the harsh sound, but maybe to love you, you must know how to get away from this or our last tacit understanding, don’t force yourself to go to a distant place that you can’t reach It&#39;s deep and I&#39;m still awake I can&#39;t bear to let you push too hard You know I&#39;m so strong and lonely I&#39;ll get used to our song sooner or later Don&#39;t force it
