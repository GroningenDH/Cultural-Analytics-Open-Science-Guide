Lyricist: Mengran Composer: Mengran Change your life to make yourself happy Give up your obsession The weather will become better A joke or a lie It’s not that complicated just remember that you are you Wu~ oh oh Wu~ oh oh I’m still the boy I used to be. Time is just a test. The faith in my heart has not diminished. The boy in front of me is still the same. No matter how hard and dangerous it was before that face at the beginning, don’t retreat Say never never give up Like a fire Wu~ oh oh Change your life and make yourself happy Give up your obsessions and the weather will become better Every time you walk through it is a harvest What are you waiting for? The right choice is the past, let it go, don’t care if it’s a joke or a lie, the way is underfoot, it’s not complicated, just remember that you are you Miya miya miya miya miya Call me Miya miya miya miya miya miya Call me Miya miya miya miya miya miya I’m still the boy I used to be without a trace A slight change in time is just a test, and the faith in my heart has not diminished at all It becomes shiny. In fact, there is no difference between you and me. As long as you are willing to draw a line of imagination for your hope, you must experience a lot of ups and downs on the road of growth. Believe that you will eventually have something that belongs to you. Your blueprint Wu~ oh oh I’m still the boy I used to be, I haven’t changed in the slightest Time is just a test in my heart Faith hasn’t diminished at all This boy in front of me is still the same face from the beginning Say never never give up Like a fire I am still the boy Miya from before I am still the boy Miya from before I am still the boy Miya in front of me I am still the boy Miya from before
