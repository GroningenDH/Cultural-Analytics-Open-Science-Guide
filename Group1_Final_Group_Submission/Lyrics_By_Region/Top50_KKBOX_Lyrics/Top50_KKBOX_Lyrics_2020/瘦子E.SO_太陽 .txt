Lyricist: Chen Yurong E.SO Composer: Chen Yurong E.SO Arranger: FunkyMo / Gao Yangchen Tipsy Kao I&#39;m used to being spoiled by you at home, I will always say that I open the curtains in the morning and you don&#39;t let me oversleep. Money can&#39;t buy the neckline you ironed for me You exist like it should be But now you&#39;re not here I have to cook and eat my own food It&#39;s okay I just want to know you I&#39;m still used to it You tell me it&#39;s better than I think I am more brave in the same space but I feel far away from it, I can’t hold you in the dark night, my heart is captured by the cold wind, I’m afraid that’s how direct I am in the same space, but I feel far away, I can’t hold you in the dark night, my heart is caught in the cold wind I&#39;m afraid that it&#39;s too direct, the sun hasn&#39;t come out, I&#39;m going to be bored, I&#39;m going to be bored, I&#39;m going to be bored, I just want to go out and enjoy the sun Everything gon&#39;be fine, I&#39;m waiting for you to come back My biggest regret is that we can&#39;t kiss goodbye Like we used to look in the video Your face is skinny like a skeleton I just want to say it&#39;s easy I need a little mansion in this cold city I feel like a small person They say people face difficulties and selfishness grows bigger I don&#39;t mind if you hurt me I know you&#39;re scared too If I can&#39;t Forgive you is like trampling on me If we can’t be together, at least we have the same hope A bunch of records sing the praises of sadness I can’t say no I think I’m living in the light but I can’t match I thought I was chilling not anymore This dark cloud can&#39;t take my hope away Kneeling down on my knees Landlord will guide me to the end of the road I&#39;ll go through fire and water Your love should be regardless of race and race Be your lover one day and become a comrade-in-arms My dear, you can&#39;t be weak, the sun hasn&#39;t come out, it&#39;s going to kill you soon I&#39;m getting bored, I&#39;m getting bored, I just want to go out and have some fun Everything gon&#39;be fine I&#39;m here waiting for you to come back
