I’ve already given you everything I can do. Maybe meeting you is a kind of luck. It’s God’s will that we can’t be separated Facing the age when I was not eighteen and loved you, at least I really have no regrets in my heart, maybe I will be reluctant to give up, and I will cry, but maybe it is precious if I don’t get it, maybe I will wait a little longer, and someone will match us for a long, long, long time when I embrace you When I look at someone else, can I smile at you and wave my hand? A friend I haven’t seen for a long time Change my role and say hello to you Who still remembers how desperately we lost your life? I’m like a tree that’s been uprooted. Myself, I can only force myself to be more independent. The rain will be bigger. It will always be fine, but it’s just a long, long, long time. When I hold someone else in my arms, maybe I will be able to smile and wave to you. Maybe I will be relieved. Breaking up is an exit for a long, long, long time In the future, when you are holding someone else&#39;s hand, our wound may no longer be painful. My long-lost friend, I wish you forever. I&#39;m just afraid that loving others may not be as deep as loving you in the future. But when love comes to an end, what&#39;s the point of crying? You can only accept love. There is no need for a long, long, long time in the future Time will slowly steal away the memories The pain I am suffering at this moment will slowly become fictional But I just changed my hands for a long, long, long time When you and I each have our own love, we are this The wound will no longer be uncomfortable. Friends who haven’t seen each other for a long time, if we meet again, we will smile and nod
