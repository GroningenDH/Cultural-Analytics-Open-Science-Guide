Lyricist: J.Sheon Composer: Razor Jiang RAZOR / J.Sheon / Lai Weizhe Arranger: Razor Jiang (EGGO Music Production) Street brothers are not only very hungry but also very romantic Listen to something special tonight It&#39;s not about some childish puppy love This melody Guess she will love non-bad stalk guava dialogue is not the kind of lyrical song I sang a few times I love you I love you I can’t remember the lyrics The humorous tape is rotten but she said she doesn’t like it She wants to hear the kind that makes me cry I said hip-hop and she said no I scolded at the sky oh it’s her calling me what to do I’m angry I want to hear something that’s easy to cry about love loser This whole person will make me feel tired and I’m crying as a result How much effort does it take to be a lyricist? Some lyrical songs she would love Rap ended up losing love songs Wanting to be a lyrical brother is not for everyone, why did her favorite kind of lyrical songs lose love songs in the end? Otherwise, I would add some R&amp;B and mix it with variety shows. She said I was crazy She’s crazy about me, she doesn’t understand it, she’s so melancholy that she wants to set off firecrackers or learn a lyrical MV, and run while crying, it’s time to wake up from the dream, it’s time to stop, it’s only because I’m not Zhou Xingzhe, she wants to hear me say hip-hop She said no, I scolded the sky, it was all her, so she told me what to do. I got angry and wanted to hear something that made me cry about love loser. This whole person would make me feel tired. As a result, I cried and wanted to be a lyric brother. How much effort does it take to write some ballads that she will love? Rap loses love songs in the end
