Lyricist: Mayday Ashin Composer: Mayday Ashin Arranger: Lai Weizhe + Mayday Arranger Collaboration: JerryC Walking in the wind Today the sun is suddenly so gentle The gentleness of the sky is like you holding me and then discovering your change If you are lonely in the future, it should be cold How to spend the scenery on the horizon I am not in your eyes What is hidden in your eyes I never understand It doesn’t matter Your world just let you have it Don’t bother is my tenderness I don’t know I don’t understand I don’t want it Why my heart is clearly I want to be close but I’m lonely until the dawn I don’t know I don’t know I don’t want it Why is the beauty of love in my heart always in loneliness I give you my best love Unknowingly I don’t want to go to the alley again I didn’t cry I didn’t laugh because it was a dream, there was no sign, there was no reason, you really said it, if there was, I would let you be free, I don’t know, I don’t want it The beauty of love is always in solitude and I will give you my best love Unknowingly, unwillingly, I went to the alley again I didn’t cry or laugh because it’s a dream, there’s no sign, there’s no reason, you really said it if there is, let you be free free this is my tenderness this is my tenderness set you free
