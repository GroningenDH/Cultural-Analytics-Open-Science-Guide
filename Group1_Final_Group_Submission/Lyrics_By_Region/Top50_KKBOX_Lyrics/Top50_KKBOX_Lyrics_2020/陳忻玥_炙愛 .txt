Lyricist: Li Jieming WML Composer: Li Jieming WML Arranger: Skot Suyama Tao Shan My heart and your heart no longer intersect I see you sleeping soundly with no smile on the corners of your mouth Why do I have to lie to myself saying that you are still the same you I no longer know Reasonable ability can only kiss you hard I want to keep you with my body But oh Feels like everything is falling And I&#39;m torn Do you understand this pain I look at you but there is no one in my heart You are my true love It&#39;s also my love, waiting blindly You look at me but can&#39;t see I&#39;m setting myself on fire You are my love and my love Smiling but tired of my heart Your hearts don&#39;t meet I watch you sleep soundly No smile Why do I have to lie to myself that you are still the same you I used to be I can only kiss you hard I want to keep you with my body But oh Feels like everything is falling And I&#39;m torn this pain Do you understand I look at you and there is no one in my heart You are my love and my love You are blindly waiting You look at me but you can&#39;t see I&#39;m setting myself on fire You are my love and my love I look at you and there&#39;s nothing in my heart You&#39;re my love and my love I&#39;m waiting blindly You look at me but I can&#39;t see I&#39;m setting myself on fire You&#39;re my love and my love Smile and get tired
