Lyricist: Chen Yurong E.SO Composer: Chen Yurong E.SO Arranger: FunkyMo / Gao Yangchen Tipsy Kao I need your help like I&#39;m on a swing This time I finally don&#39;t have a second-hand car experience in my heart. Although he is old, it&#39;s easy to support you There are still seats in the backseat. Natural disasters and man-made disasters. I’m afraid I didn’t really stand firm at the beginning. Not all of the tests God gave me were in favor. I think I’m not that great. As a good person, killing those enemies is what I can do. I have never doubted how much tolerance I have for myself, so I can understand that mortals are sometimes vulnerable. That warmth rises from the east and burns. The traces left by my life can make children look at the template and review it. In the end, they can achieve GREAT Don&#39;t you tell me you should Wait wait wait wait wait wait ye&#39;s going to be gray You can&#39;t stop the Great great great great great Greatness is destined to come Motherfucker I&#39;m gonna take take take take take take Robin Hood in the city I will pay pay pay pay pay pay Blood and sweat Like Khaled Major key Not everyone can get it. Chasing popularity is pointless. Throw some D&#39;s On that bitch. I can&#39;t satisfy my life. The coming-of-age ceremony I made for myself is such a grand scene. The advice I told the young man was not listened to or respected by me. At his age Can&#39;t tell me nothing Disdain I wish you all the best Someday you will realize Always got you back May you not be repelled Stay at home with a cigarette Don&#39;t stain your hands with blood We survive that warmth It rises from the east and burns The traces left by my life can let the children look at the template and review it In the end, they can achieve GREAT Don&#39;t you tell me you should wait You can&#39;t stop the great Motherfucker I&#39;m gonna take I got paid Don&#39;t you tell me you should Wait wait wait wait wait wait ye&#39;s gonna be gray You can&#39;t stop the Great great great great great Greatness is destined to come take tak e take take Robin Hood in the city I will pay pay pay pay pay pay those hard blood and sweat
