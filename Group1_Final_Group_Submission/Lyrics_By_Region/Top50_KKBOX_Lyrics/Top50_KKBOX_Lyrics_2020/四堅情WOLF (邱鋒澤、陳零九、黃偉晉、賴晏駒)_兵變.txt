Lyricist: Caizi/Huang Weijin Composer: Qiu Fengze/Zhang Weihong/Chen Lingjiu That autumn you told me to cheer up on the platform That erratic look in your eyes thought it was the prelude of reluctance, the loose beginning and the end have already been arranged in my mind, I don’t believe it is a script fabrication Before those days began, I never imagined that all the fears faded away on your gentle contours, and the signs of indecision appeared more and more anxious, so I let the lies patch up the gaps in my heart. Who broke my promise and betrayed me, I lost even my promise and abandoned me. Perseverance still growls I am immature Who is mutiny I never imagined before those days began All fears faded away in your gentle outline Unpredictable signs appeared more and more anxious Only then let lies patch up the gaps in my heart Who broke my promise and mutinied I even promised Also lost contact and abandoned me You smashed my attachments and yelled at me I am immature Who on earth betrayed me When I bumped into you that day You held his hand tightly and kept asking yourself if I did something wrong Dramatic emotions I thought about plain ones It’s beautiful, I’ve thought about it too, but you use this method to refute who broke my promise and mutinied me? I even lost contact with you and abandoned me.
