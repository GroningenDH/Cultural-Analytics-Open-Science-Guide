Lyricist: Lin Chenyang/Liu Tao Composer: Liu Tao Maybe the world is like this and I’m still on the road. No one can tell. Maybe I can only be silent. Tears moisten my eyes, but I’m not willing to be cowardly. I lower my head and look forward to the day. Accept all the ridicule, embrace the rainbow and move forward bravely Walking the light of dawn will pass through the darkness and break all fears I can find the answer Even if you want to go against the light, dispel the darkness and throw away all the burdens No longer alone No longer alone Maybe the world is like this I am still on the road No one can tell Maybe I can only Silent, tears moisten the eyes, but unwilling to be cowardly, lower your head and look forward to the day, accept all the ridicule, embrace the rainbow, go forward bravely, the light of dawn will overcome the darkness, break all fears, I can find the answer, even if you want to go against the light, dispel the darkness and discard everything The burden is no longer alone no longer alone the light of dawn will pass through the darkness and break all fears I can find the answer even if you want to go against the light and dispel the darkness ten thousand kinds of power will drown you alone no longer alone (maybe the world is like this) (me too Still on the way) (no one can tell) (maybe I can only be silent) (tears wet my eyes) (but not willing to be cowardly)
