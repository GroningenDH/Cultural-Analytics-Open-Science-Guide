Lyricist: Wei Ruxuan Composer: Wei Ruxuan Arranger: Han Likang In the middle of the night and sleepy to go to the recent days, I am very happy and want to call you to act like a baby, my eyes are red, I want to talk, I am thinking about it I think you know everything, right? My sadness is still raining. When will the damp fog clear? Tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick I have to take care of myself, I miss you so much I miss you so much My eyes are red and I want to talk Thinking about sitting and daring as if I don’t have a soul I think you know everything My sadness is still raining and wet When will the fog clear away Tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick Don’t worry about it, I’ll just do it for you, I’ll remember the happy one, you’ll take care of yourself, I love you so much, I miss you so much, I’ll see you one day
