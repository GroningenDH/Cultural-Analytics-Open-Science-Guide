Lyricist: Li Zongsheng Composer: Li Zongsheng Arranger: Wu Jiaen For you, I spent half a year&#39;s savings across the ocean to see you For this reunion, I even practiced breathing when we met. Words have never been able to express my affection One is because of this regret, I thought about it at night and refused to go to sleep. The memory is always slowly accumulating in my heart and cannot be erased. For your promise, I can&#39;t bear not to cry in the most desperate time. Strange city, familiar We used to comfort each other, we hugged each other and sighed, no matter what kind of ending we would face, I watched you go away in the wind and sand, but I was so sad that I couldn’t hope that I could send you thousands of miles away until the end of my life, and I will be with you for you I spent half a year&#39;s savings traveling across the ocean to see you. For this reunion, I even practiced my breathing when we met. Words have never been able to express my feelings to a millionth. For this regret, I thought about it at night. Want to refuse to go to sleep Memories are always slowly accumulated in my heart can not be erased For your promise I endured not to cry in the most desperate times Strange cities, familiar corners I have comforted each other and embraced each other Sigh no matter what kind of ending I will face, watching you go away in the sky full of wind and sand, I am so sad that I can’t hope that I can send you thousands of miles until the end of my life, I will depend on you for the rest of my life. Strange cities, familiar corners, I have comforted each other I once hugged and sighed, no matter what kind of ending I will face, watching you go away in the sky full of wind and sand, I am so sad that I can’t hope that I can send you thousands of miles until the end of my life I will be with you
