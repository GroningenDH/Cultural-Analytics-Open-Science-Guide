Lyricist: Chen Yurong E.SO Composer: Chen Yurong E.SO Arranger: Michelin MCKY Praise her beauty Praise her beauty Praise her beauty I have never met I have never met She can work hard for you Who we want to change We want to lie Whoever lies to myself I am not lonely We are all lonely Praise her beauty Praise her beauty Praise her beauty I have never met, I have never met She can work hard for you We want to be who we want to be We want to lie to ourselves I am not lonely We are all Loneliness helps to record her life, share what she wears every day, enjoy a weekend alone, but tens of thousands of people clap her hands, her beauty is not for me, she is not active on the screen, maybe I donâ€™t know too much, and when we get along, everyone is silent. Everyone is eating chicken, it separates us, but at the same time, we are forming a team. I am no longer familiar with her. Sometimes she is sad, which makes the world worry, but it is not me who comforts her. Hoping to catch her eye but she&#39;s in love with anonymous compliments not paying attention we&#39;re compromising she&#39;s not staying overnight little by little the relationship is shattering every time the WIFI connects again trying to hog her beauty hog her beauty wanna compliment her compliments Praise her beauty Praise her beauty Praise her beauty I have never met I have never met She can live hard for you We want to change Who we want to lie Who lie to ourselves I am not lonely We are all lonely
