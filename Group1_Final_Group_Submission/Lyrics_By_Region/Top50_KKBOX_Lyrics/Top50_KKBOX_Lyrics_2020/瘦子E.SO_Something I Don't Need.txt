Lyricist: Chen Yurong E.SO Composer: Chen Yurong E.SO Arranger: Gao Yangchen Tipsy Kao February Nacpan Beach The color of the tide, cool wind, white sand, ground and sea Tiffany Let’s talk a little bit of truth Once we all agreed on the definition of nothing. The more trees are cut down, the more expensive they are. I don’t want to blow my nose. I’m thinking about something I don’t need. I’m thinking about something I don’t need. On my mind I’m thinking about something I don’t need Big car big house luxury stuffed into my brain is too tacky set fire to burn the coffin goodbye the love of my life Hakuna Matata my friend ,don&#39;t let nothing hold you back please look up what a starry night someday I&#39;ll come back There&#39;s something left I should have known I should have known that one day I&#39;d run out of strength to chase me to nothing The water, grass and trees in the sea are cut more and more expensive &#39;t need Big car big house luxury too tacky to fill my brain
