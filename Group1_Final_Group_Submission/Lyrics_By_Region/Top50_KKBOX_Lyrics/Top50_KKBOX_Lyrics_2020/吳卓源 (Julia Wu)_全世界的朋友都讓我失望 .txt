Lyricist: Tower da Funkmasta / terrytyelee Composer: terrytyelee/Wang Zhiyin/Julia Wu Zhuoyuan Arranger: terrytyelee / Kin Lee Every word is an excuse, every word is an excuse, every sentence is not a promise, and I will not do what I said. Everyone says everyone is wrong. My inspiration has been lost You are drowning in the sadness in your heart, and you carry all the reasons of love by yourself. I can’t help. My friends all have reasons. They keep making me cry. The more I think about it, the more it hurts. From now on, all my friends will come back to me, smoke a cigarette and tear my face apart. There’s no choice but to be with you. Tears flow with you, wait for the flowers to fall, I have waited at the intersection every time, I am silently waiting, my inspiration is overwhelmed by you, no matter how strong these dreams are The more I think about the pain, the more it hurts. From now on, all my friends will step aside to smoke a cigarette and tear my face. There is no reason to choose my friends. They all have a reason to make me cry. The more I think about it, the more painful it will be. Cigarette tearing my face is not a choice Not making plans I just want to enjoy my grievances alone No matter how happy I am, I don’t want to go back My friends have a reason to keep me crying and hurting From now on, all my friends will quickly stand aside and smoke a cigarette and tear my face There is no choice no choice
