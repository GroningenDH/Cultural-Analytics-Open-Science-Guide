Lyricist: Chen Yurong E.SO Composer: Chen Yurong E.SO Arranger: Michelin MCKY Give me two months to tour and come back to Snap chat Let me see you painting watercolors at home I like your original appearance and don’t need to change it for me Baby I won&#39; t let you down I will give you a better life I want to make you feel happy I stay up here anytime, chatting and losing my kidneys The content of the message is too erotic, where you are, my place feels too hot, my eyes meet each other, as if the people next to me are not here We ride or die expensive jewels you don&#39;t want to wear when I&#39;m in a nightclub get into a fight Only you can hold me down I found my better side lovers and friends who stay on the screen keep coming in as long as you&#39;re still listening I can throw it away Let go of all the accusations with you I am not in a position to complain about how angry I have to be and how long it will take to meet again I wish I was there Flying to you to see the world you see Taipei is finally sunny I wish you were here especially before going to bed to see me Watching the world until my phone ran out of battery, I’m sorry I got up too late today and called you. The phone rang and I didn’t answer. I’ve already slept half a world away. Birthday I will be there I will go out tonight, I will wear it charmingly Let me check your makeup and brows are a little high I love you enjoying yourself You look a little coquettish I didn’t let you know I was in a bad mood after sending you out I wish I was there Fly Come to your side to see the world you see Taipei is finally sunny I wish you were here especially watch the world I saw before going to bed until the phone ran out of battery
