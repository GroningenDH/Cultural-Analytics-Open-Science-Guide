Lyricist: Geng Geng Composer: Kent Wang Jian You said greenness is the best first love is like light snow falling on the coastline The fifth season will be staged one day We have a time to meet You said an empty bottle is suitable for wishing in a place where the wind is warm and the moonlight You will be in the thirteenth month The corner of the sea appears as scheduled and is no longer far away You fly away proudly The summer where I live The unheard declaration has been repeated for many years The longing of the northern latitude has been blown far away by the monsoon The side face of silent recitation is blown far away Singing poems You fly proudly The leaves I inhabit far away have gone to different worlds but never bid farewell to the sea and the moon. The longing for the moon has emerged. I saw my mature smiling face yesterday, but you didnâ€™t take a look at it. You said that the empty bottle is suitable for wishing. In the place where the wind is warm and the moon is shining, you will be on schedule in the thirteenth month. The corner of the sea is no longer far away You fly away proudly The summer where I live The unheard declaration has been repeated for many years The longing of the northern latitude is blown far away by the monsoon The profile of silently chanted poems You fly far away proudly The leaves I inhabit go to different worlds but never bid farewell to the sea and the moon. The longing of the sea and the moon has emerged. I saw my mature smiling face yesterday, but you have never seen one. Blown far away by the monsoon, silently recited from the side, blown far away, singing poems, you fly away proudly, the leaves I inhabit go to different worlds, but never say goodbye to the longing of the sea and the moon, I was in my mature smiling face yesterday, but you never looked at it
