Lyricist: Zhou Xingzhe/Wu Yiwei Composer: Zhou Xingzhe The thunderstorm is still running around the world like you fuzzy stop Always thought you could love time forever but taught us a lesson The road can’t go backwards I missed the opportunity I said I’m happy I don’t care you know me best I don’t regret what I’ve done for you, as long as you’re doing well, I don’t necessarily need to have you. I say I want to be free. I have no reason not to let you go. To be honest, I’m happy to cry for you. You find your happiness and don’t waste it. How many mistakes you have made I finally understand what love is, how regretful it is. Those who have loved can’t forget. The harder I try to love someone, the more I want to let go, the more reluctant I always think that I can get it back, but you have a better future waiting for me. I shed tears for you, you found your happiness, don’t waste it, how many mistakes you have made, finally understand what love is, how regrettable it is, the people you loved can’t forget me, I’m happy, I don’t care, you know what I do best, I don’t do anything for you Regret As long as you live well, I don’t necessarily need to have you. I want to be free. I have no reason not to let you go. To be honest, I’m very happy to cry for you. You find your happiness. It’s not a waste. How lucky to meet the one I miss the most. How good it is to embrace regret
