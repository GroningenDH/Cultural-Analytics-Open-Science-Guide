Lyricist: Wang Yanwei Composer: Wang Yanwei Composer: Skot Suyama Tao Shan can&#39;t tell your outline Looking at your appearance The beauty in front of me The wind and rain dilute it Seeing the sky getting darker It&#39;s a strange sentence You look at me and speak as if I&#39;m blindfolded You&#39;re by my side When you don&#39;t answer anymore I don&#39;t have time to express my uneasiness I&#39;m a little confused and a little slow to realize that the promise is a lie You fell down and I can only watch I love more and more Love or not love becomes our burden I want to have fun Leaving my dependence, every sentence of your scolding is the price of existence, I don’t want to make me flustered, bear the pain and scold me See the sky darken again, I don’t have time to express my uneasiness, I’m a little confused and a bit slow, only to realize that the promise is a lie You fell down, I can only watch me Love more and more Love or no love has become our burden I want to leave my dependence happily How many nights of enduring pain You told me not to come back I struggled Seeing your haggard face How can I let go of my heart I don’t have time to express my uneasiness It was a little confusing and a little slow to realize that the promise was a lie You fell down and I can only watch I am more and more in love Love or not love has become a burden for us I want to leave my dependence happily I want to leave my dependence freely
