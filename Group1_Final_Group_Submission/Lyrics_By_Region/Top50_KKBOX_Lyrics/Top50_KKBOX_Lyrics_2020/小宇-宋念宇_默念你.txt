Lyricist: Wu Yiwei Composer: Song Nianyu Arranger: Song Nianyu discovers the existence of love by accident and willingly waits for reincarnation Guess again Guess from the first time expecting the world to be opened A longing to come back again I miss you silently, how beautiful your love name is, I miss you silently, you come back, we will be together forever, once held my gentle hands, once leaned on me, you accompany me to dream The only world is collapsing Should I stay or run away And I expect you to come for me Again I patiently believe in the future I fail again One day I wake up and understand who is irreplaceable Missing you silently Saying your love name is so beautiful Missing You will be together forever when you come back I know you will never be alone You will never be alone You have my love I will take you to see the sea I will wait and miss you on the other side of the sea You meditate when you come back, you will be together forever
