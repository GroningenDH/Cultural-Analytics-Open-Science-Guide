Lyricist: Wang Junpu Apollo Wang Composer: Wang Junpu Apollo Wang Arranger: Wang Junpu Don’t ask me what pain is, silently endure, get more frustrated, become more courageous, never shrink back, all you carry on your shoulders are dreams, I hope I can become a hero in your heart, don’t worry, don’t doubt yourself brothers Let&#39;s have a cup tomorrow and continue to work hard in the future. Every step of the future is mindful. You will see that my love will never shrink back. Every day in the future, you must hold your head up, keep your chest up, never get discouraged, never give up, and move forward. I can’t tell if it’s nothing to be bitter or tired. I’ll definitely be able to bear it. Life is always ups and downs. I still have to live strong. Even if the sky falls, as long as I get through it with you, I’ll be able to bear it. Don’t ask me what pain is. Endure silently, get more and more frustrated, never shrink back, carry dreams on my shoulders, hope that I can become the hero in your heart, don’t worry, don’t doubt yourself, brothers, let’s have a toast tomorrow and continue to fight for the future. Every step of the way, you will see me. Love never flinches Every day in the future, keep your head up, keep your chest up, never get discouraged, never give up, keep going forward, a man has a road in his life, always has something to say Ups and downs, you still have to live a strong life. Even if the sky falls, as long as I get through it with you, I will be able to bear it. A man’s life is a journey. There are always things in my heart that can’t be said. Bitterness and tiredness are nothing. I will definitely be able to bear life. There are always ups and downs, but you still have to live strong. Even if the sky falls, as long as I get through it with you, I will be able to bear it. I can bear it.
