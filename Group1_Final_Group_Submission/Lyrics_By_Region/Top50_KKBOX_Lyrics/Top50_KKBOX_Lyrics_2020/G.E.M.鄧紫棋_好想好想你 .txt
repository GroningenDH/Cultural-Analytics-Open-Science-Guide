Lyricist: GEM Deng Ziqi Composer: GEM Deng Ziqi Have you been doing well recently? Do you have too many troubles at work? I put painkillers in the drawer to sleep, and your pillow should not be too high. When I wake up and open my eyes, I miss you so much. I miss you so much. I really want to know where you are right now. The taste you like creates long-distance hugs How many chatting all night eating deliberately slow supper reluctance to part with you Every second you gave me the necklace I wear it until today The bookmark is your photo I miss it so much Think about you, really want to know where you are at this moment, really think about, think about, wait for the next time I meet you, really think about you, think about you, don’t want to lie to yourself, think about you every day I miss you so much I want to tell you every trivial thing in life, just give me one experience to let me know how precious you are. Only with your nights can I sleep soundly. Without you, my heart is as fragile as glass. You don’t know how precious you are. I miss you so much. I really miss you, I want to know where you are at this moment, I really miss you, I miss you, I wait for the next time I meet you, I really miss you, I miss you, I miss you, I don’t want to lie to myself, I miss you, I miss you every day I miss you so much I want to tell you so much I really miss you so much I miss you so much
