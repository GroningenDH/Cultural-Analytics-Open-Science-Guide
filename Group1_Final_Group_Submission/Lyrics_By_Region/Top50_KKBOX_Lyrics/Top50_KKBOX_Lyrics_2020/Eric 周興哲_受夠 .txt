Lyricist: Zhou Xingzhe/Wu Yiwei Composer: Zhou Xingzhe once promised the hands we once held No matter how vast the world is, only you and I have unreservedly entrusted our sincerity to lose more than we have, have believed in dreams we have promised to be together Come on when you move forward when I let go of the tears and smiles no longer free enough one step two steps three steps I missed and regretted telling you anyway I&#39;m not sad I can&#39;t find someone like you waiting I&#39;m fed up once or twice I didn’t say regret three times and never had a chance to let you understand me. I’m so lucky to have you love me at that time. I once believed in the dreams I had. We agreed to work hard together. The simplest love becomes complicated. Enough of one step, two steps, three steps, I missed it and regretted telling you anyway, I’m not sad, and I can’t find someone like you waiting for me, I’m fed up with it once, twice, three times, I didn’t say regret, there’s no chance for you to understand me, I’m so lucky to be there When you love me, one step, two steps, three steps, I missed one step before you so that you don&#39;t give up, can I do it all over again without regret Bravely hugging you and not letting you go
