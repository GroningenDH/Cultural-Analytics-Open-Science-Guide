Lyricist: Ge Dawei Composer: Qiu Fengze/Zhang Weihong You are finally willing to mark me in the photo saying I’m sorry Last week I didn’t ask you what I am I thought it was more gentle to leave He came to me but why does he seem more uncomfortable than me What do you think he wants to say I will step back Don’t embarrass everyone You’re tired too Don’t share the shame He’s not wrong It’s just that love doesn’t mean to get involved You have to hug Some people give up space and time does not allow me to dodge. I hate that I have to be strong. It’s not that I haven’t been hit. It’s just that I’m sometimes confused. I still love more than I don’t love. I’m lost. Bypassing the places you often go, memories are like sinking holes in the end. It’s better to block it but why is it even more uncomfortable after being cut off Do I still want to say something I’ll step back Don’t embarrass everyone You’re tired too Don’t share it equally I’m ashamed He’s not wrong It’s just that love didn’t mean to get involved If you want to hug someone you have to make room and go on purpose Why bother to move forward? I’m not provocative. I didn’t want to ask the reason. Whoever said that if you get hurt, you have a chance to recover. Just take it as the best memory you gave me. It’s not a misunderstanding If you want to hug someone you have to retreat
