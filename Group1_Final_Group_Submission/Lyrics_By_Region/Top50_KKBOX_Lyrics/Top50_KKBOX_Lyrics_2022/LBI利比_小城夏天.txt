At this moment, the world is focusing on your appearance wo~~~ say wo~~~ wo~~~ say wo~~~ I accompany you in a small town in summer to meet romantic evening wind blowing by your ears, you look very beautiful The slightly drunken evening time passed slowly I met my other half in a small town in the summer This city has my thoughts and loves The sweltering season is dreamy because of you The orange sunset engulfs the sea horizon The night slowly spreads out and reveals the stars to light me Listening to jay’s music in the earphones, from waiting for you to finish class to the handwritten bubbling soda and you are both summers, feeling the tenderness between the mini brows, the heartbeat like the wind, and the world is focusing on your appearance at this moment wo~~ ~ say wo~~~ wo~~~ say wo~~~ I am in a small town in the summer and I will accompany you to meet the romance Evening wind blows by my ears You look very nice In the slightly drunk evening time passes slowly I met my other half in the summer of a small town This is The city has my thoughts and love, and the sultry season is dreamy because of you
