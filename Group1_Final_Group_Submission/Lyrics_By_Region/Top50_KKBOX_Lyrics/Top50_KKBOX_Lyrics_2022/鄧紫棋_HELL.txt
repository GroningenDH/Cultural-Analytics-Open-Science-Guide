Lyricist: GEM Deng Ziqi Composer: GEM Deng Ziqi Arranger: Gongge / GEM Deng Ziqi Is it a delusion that I was murdered or you are really an illusion You let me glimpse heaven and sometimes exile you Your love is too abstract and leaves me with terrible imaginations You take me to hell From heaven I fell You ignited the fire of jealousy, it grew fiercer and fiercer And you are the culprit You incited the devil&#39;s impulse How many shapes do you have How much weight does a sentence weigh Are there countless I am How dangerous the vortex of suspicion is I&#39;m too easy to get hurt or the truth really kills You take me to hell From heaven I fell You started the fire of jealousy and it got worse And you were the culprit You stoked the devil&#39;s impulses I&#39;m imprisoned by you You can&#39;t move You take me to hell From heaven I fell You put on a fire of jealousy You made me believe You loved me indeed The truth is you don&#39;t know what love is to hell you lit the fire of jealousy from heaven I fell you stoked the devil&#39;s impulses I was imprisoned by you
