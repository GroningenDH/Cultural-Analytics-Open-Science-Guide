Lyricist: Lin Zhongyu Cosmos J Composer: Lin Zhongyu Cosmos J Arranger: Cosmos Man / Tang Chengyun has recently become used to coffee, it doesn&#39;t matter if you buy an extra cup of coffee You don&#39;t got to pay Talking from morning to dusk without getting tired Cuz baby you are my holiday I never thought of a life like this Walking down the alleys and discussing each other&#39;s work Day after day, occupying my room closet Until it&#39;s filled with your smell, I really like how you look, I want to give you my house key, put two pairs of shoes at the door, where to go, just leave, I like it, I like it You look like you are located in the same city, and you can explore each other within a short distance Copy and paste everything you have Let&#39;s make a baby Let&#39;s make a baby together Suffer the differences to save for the night Let&#39;s communicate a few more times Change the focus and focus Gradually catch little by little Occupy your last line of defense until you fall into my embrace I really like the way you look I want to give you the keys to my house and put the two pairs of shoes at the door. Wherever you go, just go. I like your appearance. Iâ€™m located in the same city. I can explore each other within a short distance. I like your appearance. Willful like a child, I will go Wherever you&#39;ll go Every bit of your most inferior imperfection is what I love most about every detail of you Whenever you frown I&#39;ll be by your side No I won&#39;t let you down Won&#39;t let you down I love the way you look I want to give you the keys to my house, put the two pairs of shoes at the door, and there is still a long way to go. I like your appearance. I am located at the same address. Just turn around and I can explore each other. I like your appearance. No matter what method you use, take me for a walk. I will go wherever you&#39;ll go
