Lyricist: Li Ronghao Composer: Li Ronghao Arranger: Li Ronghao Maybe I did say something that caused you not to laugh in years Maybe I did a lot of mistakes I made a lot of troubles in love, and then realized that distance is better for some love So can you stop being self-righteous and understand each other intentionally alienating? It’s so uncomfortable. I’m so moved and unforgettable. At that time, when I gave up, I kept myself busy. I heard that I’m gone. You forgot to take care of yourself. Now this is nothing. Perhaps it’s the result of being hard-hearted. Not to mention when I can’t sleep, tell myself to forget you, you’ve heard that you’ve mentioned me, you’ll still cry in public, it’s not suitable to be a partner, to be a friend, but you’re not willing to do that, then stick to this equal relationship, and later understand that distance is better for certain loves, so Can you stop being self-righteous and understand each other intentionally alienating? It’s so uncomfortable. I’m so touched and unforgettable. At that time, when I gave up, I kept myself busy. I heard that I’m gone. You forgot to take care of yourself. Now it’s nothing. Maybe it’s the result. Not to mention when I can’t sleep, tell myself to forget you, you’ve heard that you mention me, you’ll still cry in public, it’s not suitable to be a partner or friend, but if you’re unwilling, then stick to this situation, if you find out, I won’t take the initiative to think of you, if you go back to the past, you’ll still say I&#39;m sorry, it&#39;s not suitable to be a partner, but it&#39;s unnecessary to be a friend, then end this peer-to-peer relationship
