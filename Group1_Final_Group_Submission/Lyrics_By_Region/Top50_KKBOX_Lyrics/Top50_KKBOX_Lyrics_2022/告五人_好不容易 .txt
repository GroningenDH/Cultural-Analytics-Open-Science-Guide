Lyricist: Tell Five People Yun An Composer: Tell Five People Yun&#39;an The city is ticking, the alleys are ticking, the alleys are ticking, the alleys are ticking, the silence is ticking, your hands are slowly warming up, your body temperature is in the wrong direction, the weather forecast is inaccurate, I forgot my umbrella, my hands have nowhere to put it, including my heart is like a merry-go-round maybe This is the ending that is doomed to fail The loneliness brought by maturity is like boiling water overflowing in my heart Where do you put my heart Maybe you don’t care at all Mistaken promises for fun How can I be worthy of you My scorching marks Where do you put your heart It&#39;s pointless to pursue it any longer Accepting flustered thoughts is better than facing the silent loss in the end I can&#39;t open my mouth to say it&#39;s hard There is nowhere to put it, including my heart is like a merry-go-round horse Maybe this is the end that is doomed to fail The loneliness brought about by maturity is like boiling water overflowing my heart Where do you put your heart Maybe you don&#39;t care at all Mistaken promises for fun How can I be sorry for you and me There is no point in finding out where your heart is. Accepting flustered thoughts is better than facing the silent loss in the end and being unable to speak out. It’s hard. Wu~ Wu~ Wu~ Wu~ Wu~ Wu~ Wu~ Wu~ Where do you put my heart? Maybe I won’t be obsessed anymore
