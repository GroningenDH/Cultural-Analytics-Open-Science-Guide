Lyricist: Lin Zhongyu Cosmos J / Ge Dawei Composer: Lin Zhongyu Cosmos J Arranger: Cosmic Man / Tang Chengyun I&#39;m still revolving around you Don&#39;t think too much is the answer they gave is the same I only you can keep I cry out loudly in the night, the dream is too heavy and I can’t move, the same uneasiness binds me until dawn, the same No don’t fade away, I don’t want to hear your voice slowly and far away How can I not call back you who lost your position How do I chase No don&#39;t fade away I can understand I won&#39;t perform with tears Come back to me even if it&#39;s an expired greeting It doesn&#39;t matter I shouted loudly in the night Dreams are too heavy and weak and I can&#39;t move The same anxiety again Bind me until the dawn is the same No don&#39;t fade away I don&#39;t want to hear your voice Slowly and far away Come back to me Even if it&#39;s an expired greeting, it doesn&#39;t matter No don&#39;t fade away Unknowingly your face slowly fades away Disintegrated in memory Why can&#39;t I recall everything I was proud of You No don&#39;t fade away Freeze time How can we make love past the best deadline Come back to me Even if it&#39;s an expired greeting, it doesn&#39;t matter
