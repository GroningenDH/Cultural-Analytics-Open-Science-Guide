Lyricist: Cui Weikai Composer: Qiu Fengze/Zhang Weihong Why is the life of depression like an iceberg to cover up sorrow? Live for expectations but lose yourself. When dreams are shattered, you can only compromise. Feelings to please who is emotionally blackmailed but more lonely I understand you will be sad and weak heart slowly mottled Sometimes it is very tormenting in my heart I can’t find anyone to say it’s okay and I’ll hold you so you don’t sink the tenderness of the tip of the iceberg I understand you too You will be sad, you will be weak, your heart will slowly mottle, sometimes you will make mistakes, you have to face it, it’s better to dodge it, it’s okay, I’ll fix all the broken ones and bear it with you, don’t be afraid of getting hurt, you’ll be disappointed, we’re all the same, don’t be afraid of wandering, you’ll be frustrated, we’re all the same, don’t be afraid of it We are all the same when you get hurt Don’t be afraid of you and me Why do you choose to retreat like an iceberg Push away love and integrate into the world but pull the ego The surging silence under the sea Passionate and cold-blooded split personality The more you pretend to be indifferent, don&#39;t let it go too much. Even if you are lonely, I understand that you will be sad. You will be weak and your heart will gradually mottle. Sometimes it is very tormenting in your heart. There is no one to say it&#39;s okay. I will hold you and not sink into the gentleness of the tip of the iceberg. I understand that you will also be sad, you will be weak, your heart will slowly mottle, sometimes you will make mistakes, you have to face it, it is better to dodge it, it’s okay, I will repair all the broken things, and I will bear it with you. Don&#39;t be afraid of being hurt or disappointed, we are all the same, don&#39;t be afraid of you and me
