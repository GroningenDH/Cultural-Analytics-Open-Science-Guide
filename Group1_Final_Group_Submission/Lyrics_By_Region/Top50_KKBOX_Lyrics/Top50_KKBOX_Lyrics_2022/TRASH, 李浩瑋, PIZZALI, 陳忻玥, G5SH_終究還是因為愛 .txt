Lyricist: Li Haowei / Ah Ye / PIZZALI / Chen Xinyue Composer: Li Haowei / Ah Ye / PIZZALI / Chen Xinyue I don&#39;t think I understand the gentle and monstrous waves I can&#39;t dodge Maybe I don&#39;t understand the promise Keep love in mind someday I will understand No matter how dark the night is, no matter how fierce the fire burns, I will no longer choose to retreat from cowardice, let the flames cast persistent love into faith, you are my armor to resist all the thousands of troops, it is you who make me understand how to forgive, let go of the past, stare into the distance, do not struggle, do not struggle Resist, accept, lose the hug, hesitate until the end, the answer I was looking for was all because of love, the dazzling light illuminates the abyss, why is it so dazzling, too many limitations, what to do is the right way to do it all Is it really worth it I wish I could absorb more love atmosphere Love doesnâ€™t need to rely on others to support it Force myself to stay in an isolated island and listen to what voices come out of my head The persistent mist keeps swirling around Why does the world become so lively because love is mixed in Every minute and every second, the hustle and bustle is left behind, and the heart is finally no longer disturbed. You are my armor to resist all the thousands of troops. It is you who let me know how to forgive. The answer I was looking for was all because of love There&#39;s no deny that I&#39;ve been crying for you But it was just a path that you wanna choose My heart hurts but I understand we all tried hard It&#39;s not anyone&#39;s fault This love didn&#39;t bear fruit Let go of the hand I hold, I would like to send you away with warm love, you are my armor to resist all myriad armies and horses, it is you who let me know how to forgive let go of the past, stare into the distance, not struggle, not resist, accept loss, embrace hesitation until the end The answer I am looking for is because of love, you are my armor to resist all the thousands of troops, it is you who let me know how to forgive Let go of the past and stare into the distance Just give in this feeling And let it wash over your skin The answer I have been looking for until the end is still Because love is still love LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE
