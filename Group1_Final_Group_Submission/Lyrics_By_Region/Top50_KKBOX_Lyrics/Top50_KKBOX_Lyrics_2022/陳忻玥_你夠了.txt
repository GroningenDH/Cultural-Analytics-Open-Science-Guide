Lyricist: Chen Xinyue Vicky Chen Composer: Chen Xinyue Vicky Chen / Taoshan Skot Suyama Arranger: Taoshan Skot Suyama Bear your indifference again When you approach, you are afraid of losing control and you push me away with one hand. When I apologize, I just want to get my silence and ask me to stop talking. So I turned this love Till it&#39;s painful for us to touch Oh I burned this love Till there&#39;s nothing left but dust You&#39;re enough, you&#39;re all gone, those who loved you, don&#39;t say it, I&#39;m hurting me Till we burn each other down Why don&#39;t you stay with me You&#39;re enough, you&#39;re all gone Don&#39;t tell me this pain is enough I received your message at night and I want to go back to your arms I forgot how hard I worked before Want to squeeze into your world Am I not letting you fight so it&#39;s too easy for you to leave I can be easy anyway I will always love you So I turned this love Till it&#39;s painful for us to touch Oh I burned this love Till there&#39;s nothing left but dust You&#39;re enough, you&#39;re all gone, those who you loved before, don&#39;t say it, I&#39;m in pain won&#39;t you stay with me Till we burn each other down Why don&#39;t you stay with me
