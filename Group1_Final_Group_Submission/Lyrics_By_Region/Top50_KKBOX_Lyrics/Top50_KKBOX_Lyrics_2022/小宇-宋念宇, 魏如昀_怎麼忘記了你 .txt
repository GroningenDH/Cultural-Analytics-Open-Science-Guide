Ignore the flower of your love. My irrigation is all my fault I was defeated by time You dissipated in the greenhouse of memory Everything remained the same Why did it still go out of shape How did I forget you I was terrified I remembered your beauty and never remembered Your eyes are obviously so proud and can monopolize you but can’t Make you clear again easily Forget it, let it go, forget it, maybe you will be happier, if you can’t let it go, what can you do? Forget it, let it go, forget it, maybe you will be happier, maybe you will be happier Why am I even more desperate? How did I forget you? The more you think about it, the more unwilling you are. Will you forget me like this? Could it be that it’s not you that I miss in my heart? What I want to find is the happy self
