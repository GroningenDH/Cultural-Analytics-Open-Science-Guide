Lyricist: Wu Shenghao Composer: Lin Zhe&#39;an Arranger: Phoebe Zhou Turn off the lights again not on time Listen to love songs similar to yourself Find some love songs that want your approval Which is the most appropriate and suitable for me I accidentally cried and never learned to celebrate myself Those moments that should be lively, the more you want to live an ordinary life. When you close your eyes, you will think of people who have left the deepest scars. They are the ones that I should give up the most, but I can’t bear to let you let it go in the most blurred vision. Scars like this kind of reluctance will disappear if I open them. I close them. How long has it been since I saw you? Today I’m still wearing the white color you love. You said that you look happier. Everything seems simple and deep. When you close your eyes, you will think of people who have left the deepest memories. The scars are what I should give up the most, but I don’t want to let you let them go in the most blurred vision. This scar of yours, if you don’t want to let it go, if you open it, it will disappear. I will close it. If you can only hold me tight now, can you let me It’s true that there are many dreams because you open them and they disappear, because you will disappear when you close your eyes. People who have given me the best life have given me the best life. Thank you for letting me know that I can’t bear to congratulate each other in the days without each other. This you, this life. This kind of reluctance, if one day I think about it again, I will close it
