If it is blown away by the wind, how can I resist? How can I return to your side? When we embrace the sun, I don’t know how long the shadow behind it is. I think we are strong enough. Is it because memories lie and want to flow back? Time wants to come back to you I, I&#39;m missing you, I, I&#39;m missing you, yeah Let me go back to the beginning Let me love you all over again you, yeah It turns out that the farthest in the world is not the distance but yesterday missing you, yeah look at how beautiful the bright flower petals bloom, will she also be slowly forgotten by you The far away time has never had a trace of darkness How can you let it be forgotten When we embrace the sun I don’t know how long the shadow behind it is Thought we were strong enough Is it memories lying I want to turn back time I want to come back to you I, I&#39;m missing you, I, I&#39;m missing you, yeah Let me go back to the beginning Let me love you all over again &#39;m missing you, I, I&#39;m missing you, yeah The farthest in the world is not the distance but yesterday I, I&#39;m missing you, I, I&#39;m missing you, yeah I&#39;ll be missing you, I&#39;ll be missing you, yeah I want to turn back time and go back to the first time I met I want to turn back time and go back to that summer I&#39;ll turn back tears and find my lost smile I want to turn back time and love you one more time Say in your ear that I love you forever My world has no end without you I want to turn back time I want to come back to you I, I&#39;m missing you, I, I&#39;m missing you, yeah let me go back to the beginning let me love you all over again I, I&#39;m missing you, I, I&#39;m missing you, yeah The farthest in the world is not the distance but yesterday yeah
