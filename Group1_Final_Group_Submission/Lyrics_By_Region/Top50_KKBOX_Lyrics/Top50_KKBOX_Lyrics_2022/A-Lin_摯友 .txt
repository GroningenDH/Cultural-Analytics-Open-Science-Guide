Lyricist: Ge Dawei Composer: Zhou Xingzhe wants to be a star but is like a street lamp If you love someone, don’t love someone too deeply Don’t take it seriously I’m always emotional I’ll forget it’s impossible and you’ll be wronged for a long time But what should we use to match? I have to love someone else so you can feel at ease and let go of the responsibility. The relationship we don’t discuss is very close, but it’s not love. There are countless intersections that need to be discarded. It’s a pity that I’m playing hate. It’s not sincere. You know what kind of person I am. The relationship is just a sequel with no ending. Why is it too familiar to become a lover who can’t be touched? A close friend is also like Tang Sai. You know that I won’t wait, but you let me wait for the person you are treating with all your heart. I advise me not to be sad In fact, I really don’t want to ask one by one. It’s my responsibility to keep silent from now on. The relationship we don’t break is very subtle, but it’s not love that allows this kind of connection. I’m not strong enough to keep asking. How stupid I am. I also know what kind of person you are. What can you do? The last thing I should do is keep you in trouble. The relationship we don’t discuss is very close, but it’s not love. There are countless intersections that need to be discarded. It’s a pity that the hate I played is really insincere. You know best what kind of person I am. A relationship that no one does not envy. It’s just a sequel with no ending Why is it too familiar to become a lover who can’t be touched? A best friend is also like Tang Sai. You know that I won’t wait, but you let me wait.
