Lyricist: Wu Shenghao Composer: Lin Zhe&#39;an Arranger: Mr. Mi An umbrella with a heavy rain and a bowl of soup with a winter pair of hands with a pity to name these habits love one with me with the other with you once looking forward to with a forget from a song As soon as the song comes out, look for some clues to find the same me but not the same you. I love you too pretentious. Crying and laughing. Don’t have too much fun. This romance is atypical and not decent. I don’t feel at ease to love. I’ll ask you what you look like to be considered love. I’ve tried a few times to compose a sentence to understand my uncertain promise. Should we cuddle together or just get what we need? We just have me and you are yourself. I love you. It’s too pretentious to cry and laugh, don’t have too much fun. It’s not typical of romance. I’m worried about the deformity of love I’ll ask you to pretend to understand and accept it’s not mine I’ve loved you but never been loved I love you too disgusting to cry and laugh don’t have too much fun this romance is atypical and unseemly don’t worry about love deformity, I will ask you what you look like is considered love, your love is not considered love
