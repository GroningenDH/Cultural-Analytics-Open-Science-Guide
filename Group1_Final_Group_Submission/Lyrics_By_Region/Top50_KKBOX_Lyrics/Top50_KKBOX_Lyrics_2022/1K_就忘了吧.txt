I&#39;ve been waiting for a long time and you still haven&#39;t shown up See you again I can stand a little farther away The snow in the sky chills my heart I want to ask you how you&#39;ve been doing recently Is there a new partner that&#39;s still as simple as before Is my world the same? There are no waves, the world is big, you have to look around, you have to wander around, only I am strange in the old place, and the light shines through, just forget about the appearance in my memory, I’m sorry, I don’t understand, I hurt you time and time again, go over the mountains and over the mountains again I can’t find an existence like you, there is no existence, I’ve been separated for a spring, autumn, winter, and summer. I miss you. He’s still struggling. I stop and go alone, and I can’t find an exit. During those times when I was staggered with you, I lied to myself that I thought I can forget you, everything reminds me involuntarily, so I refused a few times, I couldn’t avoid some emotions, I can’t let others be my only one, the world is big, you have to look around, you have to wander around, only I am in the old place How stubborn I can be, what else can I do, just forget it. During those staggered times with you, I lied to myself thinking that I could forget you. Everything reminded me involuntarily, so I refused a few things that I couldn’t avoid. Some emotions can&#39;t let others be my only one
