Lyricist: Xiao Bingzhi XBC / Violation TWC Composer: Xiao Bingzhi XBC I am willing to give up everything for you until each other’s lives are wiped out. I am willing to be obsessed with you, fall in love vigorously, and dream about every day. Boiling heartbeat, passionate blood, lingering every night. Our love doesn’t have to be for anyone Ah ~ Oh You are my only poison Even if I am addicted to happiness, I still can&#39;t control Loving you is hopeless Even if my body is broken, I still long for you to hug Ah ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ Without you, there is no meaning Ah ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ You complete me Fragmented life, I would like to banish the world for you and fly far away with each other. I would like to smash right and wrong for you. Reckless, brave and fearless. Every day heals scars and fragments. Rumors and gossips every night. Our love doesn’t have to be for anyone. Happiness addiction I still can&#39;t control love you hopelessly love you even if the body is broken I still long for you to hug Ah ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ without you is meaningless Ah ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ You complete my incomplete life I love in eternity Twin flames burning souls persistent thoughts as long as we are by each other&#39;s side we are infinite you are my only poison even if happiness is addicted I still can&#39;t control love you hopelessly love you even if the body is broken I still long for you to hug Ah ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ It’s meaningless without you Ah ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ The most beautiful scenery accompany me to explore
