Lyricist: Jiang Nan/Chen Tian Composer: Jiang Nan/Chen Tian Waiting for the moment when the sky collapses and the earth cracks, I open my eyes and have nowhere to put my soul. I can only land if my soul is connected between heaven and earth. In your world, I can&#39;t bear the last of my love. The tenderness wrapped around my fingertips turned into a sharp sword and pierced me The regret in my mouth is too late If the soul is united, between the heavens and the earth, I watch the vows of the mountains and the seas, and I feel a shock in the world without you. I canâ€™t bear the end of my love. The tenderness wrapped around my fingertips turned into a sharp sword and stabs me. The distance and even the time are suspended all because you are sure that you are the only one in my heart Too late to say goodbye Too late to say sorry Too late Woah Too late Woah Farewell love
