Lyricist: Skinny E.SO Composer: Skinny E.SO / A-FLIGHT Cui Qinxiang Arranger: A-FLIGHT Cui Qinxiang Let me see your body Translate a bunch of Jealousy What a Hoe what a bitch for this song, it doesn’t matter who you play My life wants someone to know you and understand your heart Show me how you move aye Sister You know what&#39;s up The sky is clear for you I shouldn&#39;t stay on the sofa We&#39;re in a hurry This year, we&#39;re going to play a small theater in our hearts on the beautiful beach Oh absurd baby She’s younger than me Those troubles I can’t understand Looking forward to mature love will become sweeter Her high heels make her feel embarrassed Enjoy the happiness you want Sister You got it Where you get that body from Sister Keep moving Sister wants to become a young lady Younger sister, older sister wants to be called younger sister Woo My younger sister is obsessed with the beautiful flowers. Winter is coming to the end of the spring. Come to the 20th century. The colorful and creative manicure is more vivid than the middle finger. I don’t want to mess with you, idiot Belu Xiao, please go home and weigh yourself She wants you to be interesting She wants you to be interesting She wants things she has never played or laughed Forget about her faults She wants you to love everything including her side face covered with bangs The fleeting years You got it Where you get that body from sister Keep moving My sister wants to be a little sister Miss sister I want to be called my sister Woo My sister enjoys the happiness I want Sister You got it Where you get that body from younger sister Keep moving younger sister wants to be a younger sister younger sister older sister wants to be called younger sister oh younger sister&#39;s beauty at each stage of love Age ain&#39;t nothing but a number Oh younger sister Oh younger sister (sister) Oh younger sister
