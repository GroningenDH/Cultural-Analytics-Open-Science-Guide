Lyricist: Eric Zhou Xingzhe/Wu Yiwei Composer: Eric Zhou Xingzhe The wind from the embankment mixes with the sun and your smile The mistakes you made while practicing on the roof Play lightly Time don’t go counting down Dreams and memories are all branded in your heart When Amy is making mistakes, mistakes have beginnings and ends before they speak insincerely want to know What&#39;s on your mind I don&#39;t want you to disappear I don&#39;t want to let you disappear I don&#39;t say it&#39;s my tenderness Seeing you well is better than having I want to know what&#39;s on your mind Duplicity says I&#39;m not sad I can&#39;t find the best moment I&#39;m afraid of losing so love doesn&#39;t say The wind of that year took your place in my arms The hands closest to the heart beat Gently playing please don’t forget me counting down Dreams and memories are all branded in my heart It turns out that saying goodbye to someone will hurt so much Let me do it all over again I want to know what you are thinking in your heart Duplicity says I&#39;m not sad I can&#39;t find the best moment I&#39;m afraid of losing so love didn&#39;t say I always have to wait until the minute we separate to find out I can&#39;t turn back I always have to laugh until I cry to understand that loneliness is never having you by my side I want to know what&#39;s in your heart I don&#39;t want you to disappear I don&#39;t want to say nothing in life It&#39;s my tenderness I never thought of missing it I want to know what&#39;s in your heart I am behind you
