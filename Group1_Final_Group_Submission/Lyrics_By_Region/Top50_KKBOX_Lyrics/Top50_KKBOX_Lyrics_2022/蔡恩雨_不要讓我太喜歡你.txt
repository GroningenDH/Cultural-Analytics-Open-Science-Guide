Lyricist: Cai Enyu Composer: Cai Enyu Not everyone is as humorous as you. If you comfort and encourage, you will say that you donâ€™t know when you will expect your greetings. From day to night, the sun rises until sunset Are you busy? what are you doing? Waiting for your reply I&#39;m nervous about to explode So many voices in my head are always blabbering I want to say ok I&#39;m sorry I bothered you Time&#39;s up Waking up from my dream Gonna get back to reality Pray if this miracle will happen Don&#39;t worry about you and me I&#39;m not pushing OH NO Don&#39;t make me like you too much In my eyes you are 100% chocolate From the bottom of my heart I am really attracted to you Can you please don&#39;t make me like you too much Watching you walk by makes my heart beat I will be willing to accompany you through the wind and rain from the bottom of my heart I am really moved by you I will be willing to accompany you through the wind and rain Someday I will meet you in my dream and see this familiar figure from behind It&#39;s not what I thought baby I just wanna say I miss you already (babe) I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m too stupid to understand You keep bringing you problems You said you don&#39;t mind As long as you&#39;re with me you don&#39;t have any worries A kind of encouragement Time&#39;s up Waking up from my dream Gonna get back to reality Pray if there will be a miracle Don&#39;t worry about you I&#39;m not pushing OH NO Don&#39;t make me like you too much In my eyes you are 100% chocolate from my heart I am really moved by you, can you not let me like you too much, watching you walk by makes my heart beat non-stop, I will be willing to accompany you through the wind and rain ya~ From the bottom of my heart, I am really moved by you Heart ya~ I will be willing to accompany you through the wind and rain ya~
