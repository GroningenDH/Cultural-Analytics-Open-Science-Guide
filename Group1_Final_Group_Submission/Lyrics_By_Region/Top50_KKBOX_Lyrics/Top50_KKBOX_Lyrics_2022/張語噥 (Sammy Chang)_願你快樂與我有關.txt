Lyricist: Zhang Jianjunwei Composer: Zhang Jianjunwei Two people squeezed together under the same umbrella Both shoulders are half wet I really like having a companion who can take risks and rely on that picture is so cute Two people make an appointment at the same station Two people always get used to it Exchanging breakfast This love is very simple Relying on you I feel at ease I never thought that this day would come While we can still get together and get together, we can leave with a smile May you be happy and be related to me The future that cannot be reached is inevitably sad I have loved deeply No regrets Say good night to each other before we get separated and there is not too much harm Close your eyes and your warmth will always be there I think you are very at ease, I never thought that this day will come, while we can still get together, we can leave with a smile, may you be happy, it is related to me, and the future that cannot be reached is inevitably sad Saying good night to each other without too much damage, closing your eyes, your warmth will always be there Love started so naturally, love ended so bravely, didn’t cry to death, but felt sad while we were still able to get together and part ways, and we were able to leave with a smile May you be happy and be related to me. The future that can’t be reached is inevitably sad Happiness can all be related to me
