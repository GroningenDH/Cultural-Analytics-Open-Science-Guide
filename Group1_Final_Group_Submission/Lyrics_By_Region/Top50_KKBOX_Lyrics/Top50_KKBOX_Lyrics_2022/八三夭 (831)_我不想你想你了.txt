Lyricist: A Pu Composer: A Pu once easily believed in the simplicity of eternity. I used to love someone and gave my whole life. I used to sacrifice unconditionally. I used to know how to be reckless. I used to think that the long river of time would eventually dilute the bitterness. The scars and sorrows coexist, but why at certain times, the memories always suddenly churn those that I desperately forget, easily break all the happiness, I don’t want you, I miss you, I want to forget your gentle kisses, I don’t want you, I miss you, I don’t miss what you gave Cruelty how to let go of that broken innocence exhausting the rest of my life Ruthlessly turned me into an immature adult overnight Waiting for your back door after class entrusted to the youth The hug on the back seat of the motorcycle defines profoundness I only need your eyes and don’t ask much to run you with all my might Taught me how to love and hate but didn&#39;t say how to let miss without trace I don&#39;t want you I miss you I want to forget your tender kiss I don&#39;t want you I miss you I don&#39;t miss you I became an immature adult overnight I don’t want you anymore I miss you and I’m no longer hot or stupid I hate the adults who live without you for the rest of my life I don&#39;t want you to miss you I don&#39;t want you to miss you I don&#39;t want you to think of you like a migratory bird I don&#39;t want you I don&#39;t want you I don&#39;t want you I don&#39;t want you I don&#39;t want you I don&#39;t want you I don&#39;t want you I don&#39;t want you
