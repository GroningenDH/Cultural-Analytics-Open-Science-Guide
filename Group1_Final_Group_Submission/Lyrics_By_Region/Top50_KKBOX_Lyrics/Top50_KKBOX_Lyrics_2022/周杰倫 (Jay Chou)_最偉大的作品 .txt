Lyricist: Huang Junlang, Xie Di Composer: Brother Jay Chou wearing a retro suit, holding a cane, playing magic music, strolling in Samaritan, a time refurbished by the years, an empire with no boundaries, a throne built with musical notes, I used the keys to travel through 1920 and missed it Immortal, paranoia is that Magritte, the apple conjured up by me, the surreal one is me or the clown he originally wanted to paint, not the pipe, the pigeon on the face did not fly away, please remember that he is a painter, not some bartending Dali Who is Qiao Hu who bent the spoon for his thoughts I borrow your inspiration and don’t have to return it I melt the clock on the wall or the cheese lobster on the other end of the phone you don’t answer me I’m wandering is the most free and uninhibited ink painting in secular paintings Elegant legs It is a touch of nostalgia that crosses the sea in this universe. Planted on a tender and lonely branch with nothing, only the flowers that Sanyu wants can grow. The boat goes back and forth quietly to the coast of Matisse. The night under the starry sky is handed over to Van Gogh to ignite the dreamy and beautiful sky. Shouting on the Monk Bridge for a short time The bustle of the world comes from a lonely garden Flowing sunshine and the air shakes the fragrance of flowers I ask Monet for a favor Can you make a self-portrait The master looks into the distance and studies the shapes of colors Suddenly he turns back and asks me to say something about myself The impression of the king of crazy music for generations All things surrender to me The road is still rushing I am still creating the melody at my fingertips I am longing for the king of crazy music for generations I think I don’t need a picture frame It can’t frame the speed of the keys My notes It’s all about the future of art The sun rises back and forth in the harbor of impressions The light awakens the sleeping flowers and leaves The grass field is joyful for a light rain We love each other deeply The butterfly that stops on the Cambridge Bridge Flies to the emerald emerald by the midnight river It’s a pity to be accidentally Hidden in the pages of poetry is a world that cannot be penetrated by a smile The scales and claws of Paris Sentimental grammar needs to be read with music Under the light of the evening wind The traveler’s scented tea After I changed it to coffee, he fell in love with the complex word bitter because of this It’s the feeling of waving goodbye to the clouds The small boat goes back and forth quietly to the coast of Matisse The night under the starry sky is handed over to Van Gogh to ignite the dream beauty It’s too short to shout on the Monk Bridge The excitement of this world comes from loneliness
