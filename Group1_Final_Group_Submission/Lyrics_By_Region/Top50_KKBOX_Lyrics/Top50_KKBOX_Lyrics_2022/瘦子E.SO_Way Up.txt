Couch/A-FLIGHT Cui Qinxiang Arranger: A-FLIGHT Cui Qinxiang Everybody out my way Bitch you know I came to win Everybody out my way It&#39;s like destiny I&#39;m going to sit in the big seat Everybody out my way Bitch you know I came to win Everybody out my way It&#39;s like God&#39;s destiny to sit in the big seat now 2006 The naughty boy was pulled into this rap game by me We know how to push forward Battle front for a few winters I let the radio station play my records They know shit Just make money I&#39;m a textbook to strengthen your workout Stay where you are and witness the whole transformation Help you build a childhood Let you live in the HipHop world Now miss those good old days E.SO you sing fiercely Forget that there are still people who want to take risks these days I flow on it The pure society is playing Money Power Respect on the TV, which makes people change their faces Everybody out my way Bitch you know I came to win Everybody out my way like it was destined to sit now big bitch I&#39;m way up way up way up way up way up way up way up way up way up way up Not much But I&#39;m really mean it A few hearts are with me Not a lot But enough for me to walk forever Swallowing 08 is the eye of a typhoon but it makes me feel sick Surrounded by businesses selling all my fame Every week different products Skinny please take your products higher and smile a little closer to your face on the IG version It&#39;s because you can&#39;t release a new album and make a lot of money to fuck your mother, a big star
