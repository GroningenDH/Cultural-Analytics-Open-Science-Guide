Lyricist: Fang Wenshan Composer: The postmark of Jay Chou&#39;s postcard should be a commemoration of the past life. The setting sun is like wildfire burning far away on the horizon. Perseverance and cowardice are all part of me, but you say that I am not free and easy. Maybe I should let it go. Along the way I drove against the wind. Crossing the sand dunes and walking on a remote mountain road, looking at the sky in the canyon, what else is there, what scenery is still unwritten, and the wind whizzes by, but it doesn’t take away the loneliness. This road has no end, and I will continue walking for a long time. The promise I made may be many years later I am still wandering You missed the firework Wait for the wind and sand to pass before you know what you lost In the past life, the setting sun was burning like wildfire on the horizon. Persistence and cowardice were all part of me, but you said I was not free and easy. Maybe I should let it go What is there, what is there, what scenery has not been written, and the novel has not been written yet The wind whizzes by, but it does not take away the loneliness. It’s the fireworks I missed, I don’t know what I’ve lost until after the wind and sand pass, the world is too vast, and your news is drowned in the empty desert, only memories are left after the freedom I belong to, I’m still wandering. Flood your news into the empty desert, only memories are left after passing through whose freedom belongs
