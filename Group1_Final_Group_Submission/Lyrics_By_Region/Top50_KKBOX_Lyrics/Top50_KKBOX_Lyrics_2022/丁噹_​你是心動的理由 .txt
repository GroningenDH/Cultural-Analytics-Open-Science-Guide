Lyricist: Si Yi Composer: â€‹Zhang Jian Junwei Arranger: Wu Qinglong Kheng-Long Goh Every time I look at your thick shoulders Happiness is no longer wandering Why do you seem to be unable to embrace the light? Flying but I remember the appearance of being in love How should I light up the past You are the reason for my heart A joke turned into heaven Only you can make dreams run wild and crazy You are the reason for my heart Turn a comma into a distant place You are still the one I most want to go with How many times have I had to give up in exchange for simple love I can practice flying over and over again But I remember the appearance of being in love How should I light up the past You are the reason for your heartbeat A joke becomes a paradise Only you can make beautiful dreams run wild and crazy You are the reason for your heartbeat to make a tease The point has turned into a distant place You are still the wandering place I most want to go together Holding hands once again through the desolation of the world Grasping a handful of sunshine with your eyes You make me not afraid of time Ridiculous You are the reason for my heart You are the reason for my heart A joke has become Only you in heaven can make beautiful dreams run wild and crazy You are the reason for the heartbeat Turning a comma into a distant place You are still the wandering place I most want to go together How I hope to let the miss have a direction
