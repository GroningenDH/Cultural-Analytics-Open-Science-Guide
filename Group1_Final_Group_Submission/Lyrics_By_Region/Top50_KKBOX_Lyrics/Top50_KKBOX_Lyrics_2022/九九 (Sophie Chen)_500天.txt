Lyricist: Jiujiu Sophie Composer: Jiujiu Sophie Arranger: Tao Shan Skot Suyama I really want to know how you are doing, but I dare not ask about your situation. I am still counting one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, five hundred days. I miss five hundred every day I miss 500 days every day and count every day. I’m not a child. I should let go of the love of the past and accept the future. I’m living alone in a corner that doesn’t exist. I can’t rewind it and start over. I know how you are doing lately but I’m afraid of accidentally getting hurt for so long but I haven’t forgotten to count one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, five hundred days, I miss five hundred days every day, I miss five hundred days every day, counting every day, every day is not a child who should let go of the past Love accepts the future. A person lives in a corner that doesn’t exist. You can’t rewind it. You can’t start over. Why do you keep pretending that you don’t understand? You don’t have the courage or energy to face loneliness. You’re not a child. You should let go of the past love and accept the future. You live in a corner that doesn’t exist. You can’t fall back. I can’t start over why I keep pretending I don’t understand I don’t have the courage and strength I don’t want to face loneliness I’m not a child I should let go of my past love and accept the future I’m living alone in a corner that doesn’t exist don&#39;t want to face loneliness
