Lyricist: Eric Zhou Xingzhe/Wu Yiwei/Chen Huiling Composer: Eric Zhou Xingzhe Arranger: Huang Xuanming SMH To be honest, I can only accompany you to this moment when the sunset is shining. Those promises I missed and wanted to tell you have become self-blame. The best I have I didn’t give it to you. I stared at it for fear of missing it. You didn’t say it. The warmth of holding the palm of my hand had to choose to let go gently. This is a lesson that everyone must learn at the last moment. We were once so happy that we let go. If you cry, I will be even more reluctant. This is the last moment and the most precious lesson. As long as I can have you by my side, nothing matters anymore. In this last lesson, the countdown bell is ringing. Before the world fell silent, I prayed for you to be happy. What else can I do for you? I feel sorry for you. You always smile bravely. I hear you calling my name. It doesn’t matter if I have you by my side. In this last class, the countdown bell is ringing. Before the world goes silent, I pray that you will be happy. This is the last moment, a lesson that can’t be escaped. So many things haven’t been said yet, but I’ll be with you forever The sea and the sky are as far away as the Milky Way. Originally, the most ordinary wish is the rarest. This is the last moment and the most precious lesson. Every moment is the most unforgettable proof that we love this last lesson. In the end, we will definitely know how to be erased by time. Already alive in my heart
