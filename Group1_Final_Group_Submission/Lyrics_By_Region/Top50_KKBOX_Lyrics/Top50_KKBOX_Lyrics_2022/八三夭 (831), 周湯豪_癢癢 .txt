Lyricist: A Pu / Zhou Tanghao Composer: A Pu / Zhou Tanghao I also itch when I see this, I also itch when I look at that. Do you often think about where the air is fragrant? Everyone is tickling, every heart is tickling, looking for an absurdity, liberating from emotional blackmail, living a more beautiful life, not being seasick, not being an inextricable captain, riding the wind, surfing the waves, playing the Neptune until you die Elegant, don’t procrastinate, don’t procrastinate, don’t fight, haha ​​tonight, you’re bad, you’re going out and running around, shake it, shake it, let’s do it, let’s do it, give me the boldest idea, shake it, shake it, shake it, let’s do it If you want, hurry up and scratch your itch, come to Fada, don’t think about it until dawn, come shake, shake, shake, yes, yes, yes, let’s scratch your itch, I’m busy every day Itchy, lacking every day, itchy, stressed every day, Shanda being beaten by life every day, the more you endure, the more itchy you are, the more you scratch, the more itchy you seal up your bad mood, take your big heart out of the field and set off, relax, can’t let it go, see a blind phone, your head is hot and you lie down In bed, useless at home, like the nonsense left by sour people, scratch it when you itch, don’t pretend to be elegant, don’t procrastinate, don’t procrastinate, don’t procrastinate, come and shake, shake, shake, yes, yes, yes, give it to me One of the most daring ideas, shake it, shake it, let it go, let it go, let me scratch your itch, come to Fada, don’t think about it until dawn, shake it, shake it, let it go Take it, take it, let’s scratch your itch You only live one life Live the life you really want to live You have to grasp it now Whether it’s good or bad, don’t sell your dreams Never need fame and fortune to define me good life Catching the vibe Ball til I die If you want to live, just live comfortably.
