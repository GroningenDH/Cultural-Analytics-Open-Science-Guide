Lyricist: Huang Qibin Composer: Huang Qibin Arranger: After the eggplant egg is over, I have a dark desire to marry someone else. I heard that you already have other people’s children and grandchildren. The result is that you have reached the last step. Leaning on me is your gift for good life. The result is that you walk to the last step and go further and further delay. I don’t know that you are standing still. I want to hear your gentle voice. In the future, I will treat you as nothing. If our past is the place where I hold your hand or this horse is Yi to fulfill your request If the past is where I have no relationship with love, you dare to turn to be a partner I love you no problem no problem Is it you or not? I have a shadow. I don’t know whether it’s good or bad. I want to love you. Once you’ve passed the dark desire to marry someone else. I heard that you already have other people’s children and grandchildren. In the end, it’s the last step. I don’t know if you’re standing still I want to hear your gentle voice I’ll treat you as if you don’t have our past If it’s me I’ll hold your hand Or it’s just me to fulfill your request If that is the place where I have no relationship with love, let you dare to turn to be a partner Pick up your hand or this horse is Yi to fulfill your request If that is my love I have no idea, let you dare to turn to be a partner I love you no problem The problem is you or mine I have no shadow I know I want to love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you I love you
