I want to see you when I open my eyes tender kisses make me squint coffee is too late for your sobriety every breath I record all the memories this week is another desperate effort until the weekend can forget everything the party is going on I&#39;m not interested it&#39;s just the two of us Now get out of here and sit with me for a while I will complain about you so I can&#39;t find you My temper has become irritable This relationship is not favored Others keep nagging them They didn&#39;t realize that it was you who made me arrogant No need no need To make a change, I don’t want to be really lonely and quiet. There are many layers that can’t be shaken off, so I’m addicted to it. I can’t find a word to describe you. I just want to be hugged by your warmth and miss your familiar smell. No one is more reliable than you. 08 I It&#39;s killing me softly Killing me softly Killing me softly It killing me When I don&#39;t have you My addiction is killing me It bad for me That&#39;s what they think My addiction is like love It make me stink that&#39;s what I need My addiction is killing me It&#39;s bad for me That&#39;s what they think My addiction is like love It&#39;s killing me When I&#39;m without you When I was a kid, having you by my side made me feel cool Friendship years dreamed I didn&#39;t want to be little You make me dizzy and end up crouching on the ground and throwing up pretty baby Where are you going Let me say hello to you Every time I pick up a pen you&#39;re always there Thank you for reminding me that the punchline is a good idea Trying to be serious or maybe a little rebellious tonight I regret the golden song, I should have left some credits for you, I vomited all the baggage you left me on the ground, performed perfectly on the stage, I was so angry that I couldn’t make friends with you, I’ll hand it over to my dear in the next second, I want to get some when I’m drunk Baby baby Let’s have a wonderful dinner together We’re too close on the street Paparazzi want to be photographed, but they’ll choose you You are reliable 08 I want it now Killing me softly Killing me softly Killing me softly It killing me When I don&#39;t have you I&#39;m hugged by your warmth I miss your familiar smell No one is more reliable than you 08 I want it now 08 I want it now 08 I want my addiction right now It&#39;s bad for me That&#39;s what they think My addiction is like love It make me stink that&#39;s what I need It&#39;s bad for me That&#39;s what they think my addiction is like love it kills me when I Without you it killing me
