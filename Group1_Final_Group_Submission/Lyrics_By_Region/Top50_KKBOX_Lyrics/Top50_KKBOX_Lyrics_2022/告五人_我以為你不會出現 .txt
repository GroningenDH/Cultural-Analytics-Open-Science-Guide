Lyricist: Sue Wuren Yunan/Pan Yanshan Composer: Sue Wuren Yunan I thought you would not appear in this hypocritical world I thought you would not appear in yesterday when time stood still I want you to be here tomorrow when you open your eyes There is a difference between morning and midnight around me. It is no longer night to day. &quot;It&#39;s so beautiful, I thought everything was an illusion.&quot; The mirage reverses perception and subverts my thoughts. Please take me away and fly over the empty desert. Don&#39;t stop and go again and again in my heart please. Take me away from the oasis without you Don&#39;t let me live alone and peacefully I want you to open my eyes tomorrow and be by my side In the morning and midnight there is a difference It&#39;s no longer night to day &quot;It&#39;s too beautiful to think everything is an illusion&quot; A mirage upside down Perception subverts my thoughts together Please take me away and fly over the desert without people Don&#39;t stop and go in my heart repeatedly Please take me away from the oasis without you Don&#39;t let me live alone and peacefully Please tell me the clues in your eyes I think I can also treat the unknown as a promise Your persistence is my beating pulse When I keep urging my steps, I thought you would not appear
