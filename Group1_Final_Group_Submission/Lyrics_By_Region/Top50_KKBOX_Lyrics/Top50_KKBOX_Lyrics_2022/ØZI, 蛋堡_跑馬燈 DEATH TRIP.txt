Lyricist: ØZI/杜振冬/Ian Jeffrey Thomas/Andrew Beckner Composer: ØZI/杜振冬/Ian Jeffrey Thomas/Andrew Beckner WOAH What the F just happened? Why is my Coke spraying randomly and my sight starts to tilt? Is it my illusion or the whole car is turning over Switch the runway highway to hell Put the suspension on the 180-degree seat belt before I can react Somebody help me Oh I heard the screams something bad happened just now I’m still in hell I want to go to Japan Still they don’t understand Still you’re listening to this beat Still still Discussing the previous question, suddenly there is a flash, skidding, collision, head and feet floating, like flying in space, I don’t understand what’s going on, a chicken nugget flies into my mouth, sitting in G5, the society is about to lose its talents What is going on? I don’t want to yet Why did it getta be us if you want to drink Mengpo soup? I should have asked Tang Qiyang if I didn’t burn incense well in my previous life God what did I do wrong Ugh ugh I really really wanna know who will save me if I die Cuz I don &#39;t wanna die right now why what what why what what Cuz I don&#39;t wanna die right now why what why why what what just watched the marquee for 24 years and it&#39;s as short as a vibrato often goodbye I know who will RSVP at my funeral. The ending of the hunter is troublesome. Someone burn it for me. Please collect a few DEMOs in the computer and get a sum of organs to see where to donate and accumulate some merits to eliminate karma and reincarnate. And please don’t put the coffin I have Airtight I&#39;ll see y&#39;all next life No way, I can&#39;t die yet I haven&#39;t seen my grown-up girl I haven&#39;t paid the water and electricity bills I haven&#39;t been to Dubai I haven&#39;t paid off my debts I haven&#39;t paid off my pre-orders and haven&#39;t shipped yet I can&#39;t make a mistake and die I can&#39;t die Becoming a Buddha must be my nostalgia for who in the world will be the last pen fairy I haven’t managed to find a house yet My son hasn’t decided on an English name Now I want to call him Tomorrow, so I can’t swallow the pill by myself Kurapika hasn’t disembarked yet No matter if I want to I still can’t die by accident, I can’t be buried in the flames, and I can’t become the ghost of the gangster’s gun, I still have to gently push open the door of my family’s house, this wish is not big, I beg Bodhisattva, please save me, please, please save me Cuz I don &#39;t wanna die right now why what what why what what Cuz I don&#39;t wanna die right now why what what why what what in this world life is not long to reach the world of bliss that life is very long way really unbelievable so bliss the world has to go
