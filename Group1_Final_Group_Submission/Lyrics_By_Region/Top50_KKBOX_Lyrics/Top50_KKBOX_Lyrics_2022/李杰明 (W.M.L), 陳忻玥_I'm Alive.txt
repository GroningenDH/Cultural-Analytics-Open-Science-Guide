Lyricist: Chen Xinyue Composer: Skot Suyama Tao Shan / Li Jieming WML Arranger: Skot Suyama Tao Shan I can&#39;t see the light on the stage but I can see the wound on the stage I don&#39;t know who has the right to decide whether others open their hearts and close their hearts about God Do you want to be too? If you stand on the stage, it means you are also hungry. If you stand on the stage, you are also flustered. If you stand on the stage, it means you have hope. The fragrance of the fruit in your dream is all I choose. Give me condemnation and interpret the complex plaque. My face is full of eyes Maybe my talent is not rapping My talent is of course definitely not singing My talent is just a confession in words My talent is just a heartbreak Burn it down Turn it down I posted Tear it down on the label Tear it down The original self is called fear in my heart My indifference becomes like an ice storm So if you want to change, change it completely Don’t want to give up halfway It’s best not to evacuate me I think this time is testing my enthusiasm I’m still standing here… let go of those heavy, seemingly perfect, incomparably false re-cutting off the strings that makes me feel safe Cause I just wanna be free re-re-I’m now realizing the limitless freedom I&#39;m knowing the freedom Cause I&#39;m alive Emotions are grumpy and complaining is useless I know that crying is the last to laugh because the medicine is good If you can’t hold on, you can give up, but I told me this is my soul protesting, I want to fight for myself, I can’t be downcast, I want to break through all the frames, but I can’t forget the original intention Carrying a pennant to fight, Carrying a bag to fight Let go of the burden and see through Let go of the wall of your heart, let go of the sword fight, let go of those heavy, seemingly perfect, incomparably false re-cutting off the strings that makes me feel safe Cause I just wanna be free re- I know that freedom Cause I&#39;m alive Emotions are grumpy and complaining is useless I know that crying is the last to laugh because of the good medicine alive
