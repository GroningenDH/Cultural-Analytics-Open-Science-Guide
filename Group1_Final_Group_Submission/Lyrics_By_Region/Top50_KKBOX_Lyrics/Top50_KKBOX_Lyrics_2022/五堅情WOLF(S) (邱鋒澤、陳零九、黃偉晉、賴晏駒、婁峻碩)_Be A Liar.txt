Lyricist: Lou Junshuo / Chen Lingjiu / Huang Weijin Composer: Qiu Fengze / Zhang Weihong / Chen Lingjiu / Lou Junshuo Arranger: Zhang Weihong I see my thoughts suddenly become clear like a nightmare but I don’t want to wake up But my hands can’t hold me, I speak calmly, but the paper can’t wrap the fire, I’m about to suffocate, I blame myself for becoming more and more addicted, how can I tell you about the beautiful results in your mouth, the secret questions planned on the blueprint, but never in my eyes There was a flicker for a second, and I kept distance from trust. If I want to describe the familiar and unfamiliar relationship, I have already fallen to the bottom of the valley. Every lie, every silence I look at your eyes and don&#39;t want to pierce and I say and do differently Lie to yourself at your request I just wanna be a liar Be a liar be a liar liar Wanna be a liar liar lie to myself I don&#39;t care no matter how embarrassing it is Your smile is so beautiful but it&#39;s also fake Laughing with tears over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again, continue to sleep, continue to sleep, how do you want me to tell you the beautiful results in your mouth, the secret questions planned on the blueprint, but never flickered for a second in my eyes, and I keep a distance from trust, familiar and unfamiliar To describe a relationship I&#39;ve fallen to the bottom I know that you&#39;re a liar I know that you&#39;re a liar Play the right plot with you When you say and do things differently I accept every lie every silence I look into your eyes and don&#39;t want to poke Broken and what I say and do is different I do what you ask I just wanna be a liar I just wanna be a liar I&#39;m lying to me, I&#39;m lying to myself, I know I know it&#39;s not just you, I know you&#39;re lying to me, I&#39;m lying to myself, I know you&#39;re holding his hand, I choose to lose my memory, I know you&#39;re lying to me, I&#39;m lying to myself I know I know it&#39;s not just you who lied
