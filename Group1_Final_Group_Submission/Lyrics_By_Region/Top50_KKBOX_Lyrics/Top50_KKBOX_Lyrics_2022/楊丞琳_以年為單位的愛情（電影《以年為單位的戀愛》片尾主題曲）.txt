Take you as the subject of the story in years, this is love In the days when love is the title, the goal is to grow old together You must have foolishly believed how to find it Could it be that loss is doomed long ago When I think of you, I feel like a wild horse and a wild soldier Me and you Can you and I go back to the past Can you go back to that encounter Only you and only you make me believe that there is real love and the meaning of time Year after year how do I find it? It is said that loss has long been doomed and the clouds are calm and the wind is light. When I think of you, I will run wild and deserted. You and me, can I go back to the past, can I go back to that meeting? Only you and only you make me believe that there is true love and believe in time The meaning of being with you year after year I miss you I miss you I want to be with you I can&#39;t finish it I can&#39;t forget it I run towards you to find you This time we are no longer separated Through the sea of ​​people The wind and the rain pause at this moment
