Lyricist: Wu Zhenhao / Rao Huibing Composer: Lin Lewei Arranger: Zhang Chaoyu / Ke Zunyu Persistence is suitable or not suitable to make choices A lot of emotional principles have nothing to do Lovers admit that time is more like a wise man will pick out fate for us to promote a life. At the beginning, I am always naive and believe in eternal love. Who is to blame for being a passer-by? The one who speaks first becomes a saint. How many people do not love? The bad thing is that they are not honest. I will no longer cry for you, and I will no longer deliver happiness. Be brave, listen to a song you don’t want to hear, and take pleasure in insomnia Who hasn&#39;t been entangled in missing, no longer crying for you, no longer giving happiness I am always naive and believe in eternal love until newcomers become passers-by and who is to blame? The one who speaks first becomes a saint. How many people who don’t love are bad because they are not honest. I will no longer cry for you and no longer deliver happiness Just take pleasure in insomnia Why bother to be serious Who doesn’t dwell on longing No more crying for you I don’t want to deliver happiness I won&#39;t cry for you anymore, I won&#39;t give you happiness anymore, I&#39;ll be brave and listen to a song I don&#39;t want to hear, recalling the profoundness you gave me. This melody is your synthesis. Accompany me on a journey to slowly correct my soul.
