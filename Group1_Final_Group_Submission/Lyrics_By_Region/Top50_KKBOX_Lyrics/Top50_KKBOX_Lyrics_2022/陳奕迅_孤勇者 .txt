Lyricist: Tang Tian Composer: Qian Lei Arranger: Qian Lei is brave You have a wound on your forehead Your differences You don’t have to hide your mistakes You don’t have to hide your old doll Your mask Your self They say bring light to tame every monster They say you need to have your wounds stitched up No one loves a clown Why is loneliness not honorable People are only imperfect and worthy of praise Willing to cry Love your tattered clothes but dare to block the gun of fate Love you and me so like a gap Are you going? Does it match? This ragged cloak fight? fight! With the humblest dream to the whimpering and roaring in the night who said that the one who stands in the light is considered a hero they say quitting your madness is like wiping off the dirt they say you have to go up the steps and the price is to bow your head then Let me not ride the wind and be as proud of that kind of lonely bravery as you. Who said playing chess is not a hero? I love you walking alone in a dark alley. Destiny&#39;s gun loves you and me so like notch all the same go? Does it match? This ragged cloak fight? fight! With the humblest dream to the whimpering and roaring in the night who said that standing in the light is a hero Your mottledness is different Your silence is deafening You Are The Hero I love you walking alone in a dark alley I love you the way you don’t kneel Have you faced despair and refused to cry (You Are The Hero) Love you came from the wilderness all your life without anyone&#39;s light Will you build your city on the ruins? go! To fight with the humblest dreams? fight! With the most solitary dream to the sobs and roars in the dark who said that those who stand in the light are heroes
