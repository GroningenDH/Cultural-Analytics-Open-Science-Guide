Lyricist: Yalu Composer: Matt I can&#39;t resist your blue eyes A pair of glass beads speaks of melancholy I hope time will stop so I won&#39;t run away because of fear and leave You sleep in my mind The memory is like a shadow in the air I want to do it all There is a way to capture your beauty, but in exchange for more distance. Could it be that everything is just an illusion? The splendor is too late to get close. I can’t resist your blue eyes. A pair of glass beads speak of melancholy. I hope that time will stop so that I won’t run away because of fear. Fuck you The memory that sleeps in my mind is like a shadow in the air I tried my best to capture your beauty but in exchange for more distance Could it be that everything is just a phantom, gorgeous but it is too late to get close I can&#39;t resist your blue eyes A pair of glass Zhu tells melancholy I hope that time will stop so I won&#39;t run away because of fear So close but I can&#39;t touch you I have to treat everything as a game of God If it is destined, this love for you will always be hidden in my heart so I can&#39;t see you so I call you, this is the strongest echo from my heart, I chose to give up, left my world and went away... I can&#39;t see your blue eyes, now I&#39;m no longer lying here, I hope time will stop, and your sleeping expression will live forever in my heart
