a young heart\nThose things are gonna break after the getting's good\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\n'Cause the new wears off and they get to gettin' old\nYeah, sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll\n\n[Chorus]\nThey say nothing lasts forever\nBut they ain't seen us together\nOr the way the moonlight dances in your eyes\nJust a T-shirt in the kitchen\nWith no make-up and a million\nOther things that I could look at my whole life\nA love like that makes a man have second thoughts\nMaybe some things last forever after all\nYou might also like[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Chorus]\nThey say nothing lasts forever\nBut they ain't seen us together\nOr the way the moonlight dances in your eyes\nAnd I know there'll be that moment\nThe good Lord calls one of us home and\nOne won't have the other by their side\nBut Heaven knows it, that won't last too long\nMaybe some things last forever after all\n\n[Outro]\nAfter all17Embed", "Go Crazy Lyrics[Intro: Chris Brown]\nOh, yeah\n(Oh, is that Kaniel

\'em, peeled the car\nHad a mask on, Draco make \'em beat box\n\n[Verse 2: Juice WRLD]\nI\'ve been daydreaming when I\'m on the percs\nNiggas broke as a joke, they ain\'t puttin\' in work\nWe all toting them poles, we\'ll take a few souls\nEven my lil\' bitch got a gun in her purse\nIt\'s been about three months, I was sippin\' that syrup\nHad me sleepwalkin\', talking with a slur\nIf I catch him walking, leave him on the curb\nDesert Eagle will shoot him, call it Larry Bird\nPlay with your bitch, yeah she insecure\nShe know that I\'m Juice Man, 2Pac Shakur\nShe know that I know how to make pussy purr\nYour nigga he ugly, he creepin\', a nerd, ayy\nHuh, I\'m sure he probably be slippin\' hoes roofies for sure\nI don\'t need no molly for me to be savage\nI don\'t need no molly to give you the world\nGot a couple AP\'s, I don\'t fuck with no Pateks\nBut guess it\'s the best, so I got \'em, they dance\nAnd I\'m rich as a bitch, I don\'t know how to manage\nBank account like the zoo, goin\' apes and bananas\nSmokin\' dope \'till I choke up and rollin\' up Runtz\nYou want smoke then my niggas\'ll give you the cancer\nLike a bad TV show in this ho, you\'ll get cancelled\nI\'m Michael Jackson, nigga, you Randy, uh\nDo it so effortless, make it look easy\nI gave my girl dick when she screamin\' out, "Feed me"\nOne in the head, F.N on preheat\nHit a bitch nigga face, ain\'t CB, RiRi\nDiamonds on water, my VVS on Fiji\nI\'m magic even when I\'m bored, Ouija\nNiggas need me to make an all-star team\nTake the score motherfucker, I know you need me\nNo limit nigga, on limitless pills\nI been high for a minute, this shit gettin\' critical\nMy baby told me that she\'ll kill for me\nThat turn me on, so I eat the pussy like cereal\nI\'m doin\' shit that I wasn\'t a year ago\nI go to London, come back, I\'m like, "Cheerio"\nHang with the criminals, you get to trippin\'\nThey blickin\', break your ass down, mineral (Mineral)\nYou might also like[Interlude 2: Juice WRLD]\nMhm, niggas gettin\' mad at me I got idol money, like\nThey keep that shit, it\'s gon\' be a no from me, dawg, haha\nOn bro, I be talkin\' my shit, rich nigga shit\nI could back it up though,

my big four shit\nReady to get it started, bitch, I got no sense\nOh, he the plug, ridin\' \'round with four bricks\nCall me Kobe, twenty-four on me\nCan\'t fuck wit\' her no more, bad lil\' bitch, she do the most\nI get my groove on every time I see them folks\nI got the antidote, I\'m thinking that\'s something you need to know\nI\'m smooth and I\'m cold, she know my wrist on froze\nSkinny jeans on with a big bankroll\nShe playin\' my song, I got her takin\' off her thong\nI\'m tryna get it on, she feeling all over my Peter bone\nTwo rights don\'t make a wrong, it just go on and on\nI\'m kickin\' shit like Jackie Chan today, got my kicks on\nI aim, I hit my target, I\'ma up this bitch regardless\n[Chorus: SpotEmGottem]\nBur— Bur— Burn away a carbon beam, knock your legs

right through you\nI can read your mind, I can read your mind\nWhat you wanna do?\nIt\'s written all over your face, times two\n\'Cause I can read your mind, I can read your mind\nI can hear your thoughts like a melody\nListen while you talk when you\'re fast asleep\nYou stay on the phone just to hear me breathe\n(On repeat)\n\n[Coro]\nQuién lo diría que se podría\nHacer el amor por
