girls, chasin\' a shot with a lime\nShe was laughin\', they were darin\' her to get on the mic\nOne of \'em walked up and turned in her name\nNext thing I knew, man, she was up on the stage, singin\'\n[Chorus]\n"Heads Carolina, tails California"\nMaybe she\'d fall for a boy from South Georgia\nShe\'s got the bar in the palm of her hand\nAnd she\'s a \'90s country fan like I am\nHey, I got

word by heart, didn\'t need no screen, no\nI was raisin\' my glass up for her, I saw her smilin\' at me, yeah\nShe had me down in the front by the end of verse two\nLike there wasn\'t no one else in the room, we were singin\'\n\n[Chorus]\n"Heads Carolina, tails California"\nMaybe she\'d fall for a boy from South Georgia\nShe\'s got the bar in the palm of her hand\nAnd she\'s a \'90s country fan

can handle every family burden\nWatch as she buckles and bends but never breaks\nNo mistakes, just\nPressure like a grip, grip, grip, and it won\'t let go, whoa\nPressure like a tick, tick, tick \'til it\'s ready to blow, whoa-oh-oh\nGive it to your sister and never wonder\nIf the same pressure would\'ve pulled you under\nWho am I if I don\'t have what it takes?\nNo cracks, no breaks\nNo mistakes,
