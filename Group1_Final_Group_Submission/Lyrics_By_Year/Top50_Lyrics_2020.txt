noise\nBaby, keep on dancing like you ain't got a choice\nSo come on (Come on), come on (Come on), come on\nLet's get physical\n\n[Verse 2]\nAdrenaline keeps on rushing in\nLove the simulation we're dreaming in\nDon't you agree?\nDon't you agree?\nI don't wanna live another life\n'Cause this one's pretty nice\nLiving it up\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWho needs to go to sleep when I got you next to
