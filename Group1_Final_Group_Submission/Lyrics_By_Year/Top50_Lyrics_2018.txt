How long have you lived together? Why are you like a specimen stuck in my heart? What’s wrong? They say I’m selfish. I made a mistake of stealing time. Copy and paste your love.

It’s a lie with names and surnames, it’s friendship, but it’s so estranged. How many people love me, but you can’t let it go In fact, waiting for you is the only tacit understanding, will you miss it again? I’m not sure. I can’t count how many New Year’s Eves. If I still miss it, it’s too early. The ones behind the head didn’t do anything wrong. They said they were selfish. I made a mistake of stealing time. Copy and paste your love. It’s also wonderful. I really want to be brought up by you again, I even lied about my name and surname, pretending to be a friendship, but alienated so much that I can’t let it go. You are an open secret, only you haven’t exposed me, no matter how hard I think, it’s nothing to do with me. Where does the courage come from?
