    "## Working with Missing Data\n",
    "The types of \"missing-ness\" are three:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) **Missing Completely at Random**: When there is data missing and there is no deeper explanation to why the data is not there.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) **Missing at Random**: When we can predict the value of a variable based on the value of another variable. For example, by knowing the type of the tree we might be able to predict the height.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) **Structurally Missing**: it is the data that is missing because we wouldn't expect a value there to begin with. Let's say that we want to measure the fruits on the trees. In some trees the fruits might be visible and thus countable, whereas in some other trees the fruits might not be visible and thus uncountable; the latter doesn't mean that they do not exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to decide what to do with the missing data. Even if we decide not to do anything, it also affects our analysis. Take care of the missing data at the early stages of the analysis!\n",
    "\n",

    "## Validity\n",
    "**Validity** of a dataset is when a dataset actually measures what we think it measures.\n",
    "Validity is a special kind of quality measure since it's not only about the dataset itself but it also connected to the purpose of its dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some datasets are good to answer a question but not other questions. We undermine the validity of a dataset only if we use it in order to answer a question that it is not possible to be answered using a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, we know that you can measure the age of a tree by counting the rings, but we didn’t do that. Let’s say that we did measure the width of the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "We decide that since number of rings and width are related, we will use width as a proxy for the age. With that decision, we just compromised the **validity** of our dataset. Our data doesn’t measure age, it measures width. And even though there is a relationship between the number of rings and the width, it’s not a direct relationship and therefore cannot be substituted without affecting the validity of our dataset and measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let’s say that we want to know how much our trees grow every year. We found a dataset for the same region from 20 years ago. We use the locations to match up the old and new measurements. But this data can tell us how much they grow every 20 years, not every year. If we try to use these two datasets to measure yearly growth, we will compromise the **validity** of the dataset again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using proxies and inappropriate time spans are just two ways to compromise the validity of a dataset. There are infinite ways in which a given dataset is not valid for answering a given question.\n",
    "\n",
    "One easy way to spot issues with the validity of the dataset is to ask:\n",
    "**Does this variable measure what I think it does?**"

    "\n",
    "**Sample** is the number of observations that we have data about.\n",
    "A sample should be representative; in other words, it should include observations from every different sub-category of the population (e.g., people from every skin colour, race, ethnicity, etc.). In some cases, if we choose randomly a sample from the population yields more robust result since we avoid the cherry-picking of a sample that answer our questions."

For example, if we can't go to a certain area that is important for our sample, we collect the data only from areas where we have some kind of access. To some extent, this is also connected to the validity of the dataset as we saw [earlier](https://groningendh.github.io/Cultural-Analytics-Open-Science-Guide/code/23-Data-Types-and-Quality.html#validity)."
