was both a commercial and critical hit: It peaked at <a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/music/Missy-Elliott/chart-history/hot-100\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">No. 2 on <em>Billboard</em>’s Hot 100</a> (a spot in helf for 10 weeks, being held off from the top spot by Eminem’s <a data-api_path=\"/songs/207\" href=\"https://genius.com/Eminem-lose-yourself-lyrics\" rel=\"noopener\">“Lose Yourself”</a>), making it Missy’s biggest hit, and was named the best single of 2002 in <a href=\"http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/pnj/pjres02.php\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The Village Voice’s Pazz &amp; Jop poll</a>. The song memorably features backward lyrics and an elephant trumpting. It also helped popularize the term \"badonkadonk.” The song is a raunchy ode where Missy raps about sexing up guys. In his review of <em>Under Construction</em>, <a href=\"http://www.allmusic.com/album/under-construction-mw0000231192\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">allmusic’s John Bush</a> said the song, “turns the tables on male rappers, taking charge of the sex game, matching their lewdest, rudest rhymes.”</p>\n",
       "<p>This music video features the young hip hop dancer, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alyson_Stoner\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Alyson Stoner</a>, who in 2015 choreographed <a href=\"http://www.people.com/article/alyson-stoner-missy-elliott-work-it-video-tribute\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">a tribute to Missy Elliott</a> for “the opportunity to dance for [her] and now carve a path of [her] own.”</p>\n",

because we are truly like brother and sister. I remember I begged him to go to some mom and pop stores to get some break beats because we had been in the studio two weeks straight and had a block; we couldn’t think of anything. He finally got some records and caught this vibe and when I heard the worm sound, I was jumping up like, “That’s it!” So I would record in another room because I never record in front of anyone, and I ran and did my rap. Then I ran back and said, “Yo play it to him” and he said, “Nah, that ain’t it.” Then I went back again [and] brought it back and he said, “Nope, that ain’t it.” Then a third time, the same thing. By this time I thought he was being funny, so I’m pissed! By the fifth time he said, “Yes, that’s it! That shit hot!” But guess what? I got him back on the [Miss E…] So Addictive album, he thought we was done and I said, “Nope, that ain’t it!” about three times. Then he did “Get Ur Freak On” and I said, “Yup, that’s it!” Lol.</p></blockquote>\n",
